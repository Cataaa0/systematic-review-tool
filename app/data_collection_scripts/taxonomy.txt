\section{Taxonomy}
\label{resultados}
After analyzing the literature studying the robustness of interdependent networks, a thorough study of it was performed. From that study we identified relevant framework aspects. In tables \ref{catsummary}, and \ref{catsummary2} we have a summary of the model, metric, studies, and networks tested classifications. The details of each aspect are presented in the corresponding subsections.


In subsection \ref{model}, frameworks are classified by the kind of model used by such a framework. In subsection \ref{metric}, frameworks are classified by the kind of robustness measure used by such a framework. In subsection \ref{study}, frameworks are classified by the kind of studies performed by the framework. Finally, in subsection \ref{nework-test}, frameworks are classified by the kind of networks used to test the framework.


\subsection{Interdependent network model}
\label{model}
Each framework must use an interdependent networks model, in which the interactions between nodes are defined. The interactions defined by the model may be between nodes within the same network, or from different networks, and these interactions can determine the behaviour and characteristics of nodes and edges. The model used by a specific framework reflects the kind of networks that it studies. Some models will be applicable to more general networks, while some others will be applicable to more specific networks. According to the papers studied for this review, 11 classifications of interdependent networks models were identified: ``One to one like'' (48), ``Geometric or spatially embedded'' (12), ``Multiple dependencies'' (15), ``Coupled power grid'' (9), ``Load transfer among networks'' (6), ``Mixed interactions'' (6), ``mapping'' (2), ``directed support-dependency'' (2), ``contagion or influence'' (2), ``supply-chain'' (1), and ``defined by probabilities'' (2).


% one to one like
The ``one to one like'' classification contains the models whose main characteristic is that the interactions among networks are one to one with bidirectional dependencies, that is, each node can be connected to exactly one other node in the other network, through a non-directed inter-link. If a node fails, then its dependent node will also fail, and vice versa. The models within this classification usually present two interacting networks. They do not present interactions between nodes of the same network, and each node on both networks is inter-connected through an interlink \cite{buldyrev2010catastrophic,huang2011robustness,zhou2012assortativity,hu2013percolation,schneider2013towards,watanabe2014cavity,zhou2014simultaneous,chattopadhyay2015towards,yuan2015breadth,radicchi2015percolation,cheng2015cascade,grassberger2015percolation,ranjanglue,lee2016hybrid,di2016recovery,gaogao2016shell,rueda2016reducing,chai2016resilience,ji2016improving,wang2016robustness,juan2017percolation,chattopadhyay2017designingbudget,chattopadhyay2017designing,wang2017preferential,pan2017core,tyra2017robustness,gong2017enhancing,kazawa2017effectiveness}. However, some models do study the case in which there are more than two interacting networks \cite{gao2012robustness,dong2013robustness,shao2014robustness}, or present variations on the behaviour within the network. Among these, we find models that have loads and capacities that can trigger further failure if the load of a node or edge exceeds its capacity due to load redistribution in case of failure \cite{wang2014robustness,wang2015cascading,liu2016redundant,chen2015cascading,tan2015robust,zhou2017overload}, models where the distances from a node to a control node is relevant to establish connections \cite{rueda2017improving}, or models that explore the `average lifetime' of a node after which the node fails \cite{zhang2013reliability}. Following a similar idea, Stippinger et al.~\cite{stippinger2014enhancing} introduces the concept of `recovery' on a one to one like model. Here, nodes have a probability of reestablishing their connections after losing them. Radicchi et al.~\cite{radicchi2013abrupt} uses a model with edge weights that affect the percolation phase transition of the system. There are also one to one like models where each node can be connected to at most one other node in the other network \cite{zhou2013percolation,shao2014robustness,gong2015enhancing,ganin2016operational,sun2016impact,zhang2016cascade,chattopadhyay2015towards,chattopadhyay2017designing,panduranga2017generalized}. Liu et al.~\cite{liu2016cascading} presents a case where if a node fails, then its counterpart may lose its edges with some probability. Here, the worst case scenario is the one where all the edges are lost, which is equivalent to the original one to one like model. It is worth noting that in this classification we also consider multiplex networks whose main characteristic is to be multiplex networks where the failure of a node in any layer means that the node fails in each network \cite{zhou2017overload,kazawa2017effectiveness}.


% Geometric/spatial
``Geometric or spatially embedded'' models are characterized for representing an environment with a `spatial context', meaning that nodes can have a relative or absolute position in space, and this position in space influences whether a pair of nodes get to be connected or not \cite{danziger2013interdependent,bashan2013extreme,kornbluth2014cascading,adler2014study,berezin2015localized,lee2016hybrid}. A common model among this classification is the one built using two lattices and one to one like interactions with spatial restrictions to connect two nodes on different networks \cite{li2012cascading,danziger2013interdependent,bashan2013extreme,adler2014study,berezin2015localized,lee2016hybrid}. There are some variations to this last model, such as a model that allows more than two networks to be interconnected \cite{shekhtman2014robustness}, a model that considers network `lifetime' \cite{limiao2016reliability}, a model that uses lattices with an arbitrary number of dimensions \cite{lowinger2016interdependent}, or systems where nodes have states that can be propagated over the networks \cite{shu2017social}. In the work presented by Kornbluth et al.~\cite{kornbluth2014cascading}, networks are topologically identical, and two nodes from different networks can be connected if the path length between the topological counterparts of both nodes within a network, meet the length restriction. Finally, in the work of Wang et al.~\cite{wang2016modeling}, nodes from all networks are located within a Euclidean space, and two nodes from different networks are connected if they meet the spatial restrictions.


% multiple dependence
One main characteristic of ``Multiple dependencies'' models is that the nodes can be inter-connected to multiple nodes on other networks. Among these models, we find those with directed support-dependency relations among networks, where a node remains functional if at least one of its supporting nodes in other networks remains functional \cite{qiu2013optimal,qiu2013effect,dong2014analysis,reis2014avoiding,chattopadhyay2015towards,liu2017balancing}, and directed support-dependency relations with node states where a node must also be on an `active' state to remain functional\cite{roth2017emergence}. In this classification we can find models where the support-dependency relations between nodes from different networks are undirected. Here, just as the directed case, a node remains functional if at least one of its supporting nodes in other networks is functional, but in this case supporting nodes are supported by their dependent nodes \cite{nguyen2013detecting,jiang2014effect,li2015robust,fan2017robustness,chattopadhyay2017designing}. Among these kinds of models we find variations such as models that have loads and capacities within the networks \cite{qiu2013optimal,qiu2013effect}, models that represent supply-demand dynamics \cite{di2017cascading}, and models where each node requires a specific amount of supporting nodes \cite{cui2017cascading,zhao2017enhancing},.


% power grid coupled
For the ``Coupled power grid'' classification, we have models that represent the power grid network coupled to some other network. Most of the models within this classification represent the power grid coupled with its control network. For the `power grid-control network' pairs, the models contain a representation of the power grid, and a representation of the control network that supervises the proper functioning of the power grid network (Control Network, or Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition). The control network model usually distinguishes between the nodes that represent information sources, and the nodes that distribute this information. Among the models that represent the `power grid-control network' pair, there are those whose nodes and edges have loads and capacities, which can get damaged due to overload failures \cite{huang2015cascading,ouboter2014design,han2016improved,korkali2017reducing,cai2017modeling}, and those that do not have loads and capacities \cite{huang2015small,matsui2014modeling,parandehgheibi2013robustness}. Only one model was found to represent the power grid coupled to another kind of network in the work of Ouyang et al.~\cite{ouyang2015resilience}. Here, the power grid is coupled to the gas distribution network, which depends on the electric supply of the power grid to properly function.

% Load transfer among networks
On the ``Load transfer among networks'' classification a total of 6 articles was found \cite{zhao2015cascading,zhang2015effect,hong2015cascading,wang2016study,zhu2016fuzzy,xia2016effect}. The main characteristic of these models is that the nodes and/or edges have a capacity and a load, where if a node fails, then the load of that node is redistributed within and among networks. It is interesting to notice that a real world application of these models is presented by Zhao et al.~\cite{zhao2015cascading}, where the system is comprised of the bus network, and the subway network, while the passengers represent the network load.


% mixed interactions
For the ``mixed interactions'' classification, six articles were found \cite{kotnis2015percolation,dong2015robustness,zhao2016robustness,liu2016cascadinginner,du2016targeted,klosik2017interdependent}. The main characteristic of these models is that there may be more than one type of interaction among them \cite{kotnis2015percolation,dong2015robustness,zhao2016robustness,du2016targeted}, or within them \cite{liu2016cascadinginner}. In this type of model, there are different types of edges, and the type of edge defines what happens to the neighbors of a node when it fails. For the interactions, we may have connectivity and dependency edges \cite{dong2015robustness,zhao2016robustness,liu2016cascadinginner,du2016targeted,klosik2017interdependent}, or dependent and antagonist edges \cite{kotnis2015percolation}. In this context, an antagonistic relationship between nodes means that losing the antagonistic counterpart has a positive effect over the nodes.


% Mapping
The ``Mapping'' classification contains models that represent network pairs where one network must be `mapped' or `routed' onto other networks \cite{zhang2011overlay,alashaikh2016supporting}. Thus, the mapped network depends on the structure of the other network, and the way in which the mapping is done.


% directed support-dependence
On the ``Directed support-dependency'' classification we find models whose main characteristic is to have support-dependency relations between network pairs. Here, it is clear which node offers support and which node is dependent \cite{parshani2010interdependent,gao2013percolation}. If the support node fails, then the dependent node will necessarily fail. However, if the dependent node fails, then the support node will not necessarily fail.

% contagion/influence
The ``Contagion or influence'' classification contains models whose objective is to model an influence or contagion process within an interdependent networks system. In this revision two articles were found \cite{min2014diversity,sahneh2017contact}.


% probability defined mode
Finally, the models classified into the ``Defined by probabilities'' classification are those whose behaviour (dependencies, failures, recoveries, etc.) is defined through probabilities. Two articles were found within this classification \cite{rahnamaycascading,liu2017stochastic}.%The only model found within this category is the one presented by Rahnamay-Naeini et al.~\cite{rahnamaycascading}, where each node has a probability of failure. Here, a node failure may affect the probability that its interdependent nodes also fail.

% supply-chain
The ``supply-chain'' classification contains models whose main characteristic is to represent supply chain networks systems. Within this classification we found a model composed by a physical supply chain network (supplier, distributor, etc.), and a cyber-network that represents the digital control system of the supply chain \cite{tang2016complex}.




\subsection{Kind of robustness metric used}
\label{metric}
Frameworks can use a variety of metrics to study the robustness of a network. A framework may use one or more metrics to measure the interdependent networks robustness. The metrics used by a framework to measure robustness determine which aspects are relevant for the framework when defining what a robust network is. In this study 8 metric classifications were identified: ``Counting elements'' (77), ``Breaking point'' (44), ``Time'' (14), ``Probability'' (12), ``Rate'' (3), ``Cost'' (3), ``Path length'' (4), and ``Performance'' (1).


% amount
``Counting elements'' metrics, measure the amount of elements relevant for the robustness, such as the amount of nodes on the largest connected component. In this classification we also include metrics that extract a value from the amount of elements being counted, such as the average amount of neighbors of a node. Within these metrics, we distinguish between those who measure the amount of nodes that remain functional after a failure or attack (and subsequent cascading failure) \cite{parshani2010interdependent,huang2011robustness,zhou2012assortativity,li2012cascading,gao2012robustness,dong2013robustness,zhou2013percolation,hu2013percolation,gao2013percolation,schneider2013towards,bashan2013extreme,nguyen2013detecting,watanabe2014cavity,shekhtman2014robustness,zhou2014simultaneous,kornbluth2014cascading,shao2014robustness,stippinger2014enhancing,jiang2014effect,matsui2014modeling,reis2014avoiding,ouboter2014design,kotnis2015percolation,grassberger2015percolation,yuan2015breadth,tan2015robust,dong2015robustness,hong2015cascading,chattopadhyay2015towards,chen2015cascading,li2015robust,zhang2015effect,cheng2015cascade,huang2015cascading,huang2015small,wang2016modeling,du2016targeted,wang2016robustness,zhu2016fuzzy,zhang2016cascade,liu2016cascading,liu2016cascadinginner,zhao2016robustness,di2016recovery,ganin2016operational,liu2016redundant,wang2016study,gaogao2016shell,chai2016resilience,tang2016complex,xia2016effect,ji2016improving,shu2017social,kazawa2017effectiveness,fan2017robustness,chattopadhyay2017designing,chattopadhyay2017designingbudget,wang2017preferential,cui2017cascading,pan2017core,panduranga2017generalized,roth2017emergence,tyra2017robustness,zhou2017overload,klosik2017interdependent,di2017cascading}, those who measure the amount of nodes lost after a failure \cite{zhou2014simultaneous,wang2014robustness,wang2015cascading,adler2014study,han2016improved,lee2016hybrid,liu2017balancing,liu2017stochastic,zhao2017enhancing}, those who measure the amount of functional nodes on a recovery process \cite{gong2015enhancing,gong2017enhancing}, and those that measure the amount of redundant paths of a network onto the network it was mapped on \cite{zhang2011overlay} (see subsection \ref{model}).


% breaking-point
The ``breaking point'' classification, considers metrics that measure the point at which the interdependent system will collapse. These metrics, for example, could measure the amount of nodes or edges to be removed in order for the networks to collapse, the expected lifetime before collapse, etc. For interdependent networks, the collapse of the system is abrupt once the `breaking point' is reached. Within this classification, we have metrics that measure the amount of nodes that can be removed before collapse \cite{buldyrev2010catastrophic,parshani2010interdependent,huang2011robustness,zhou2012assortativity,li2012cascading,gao2012robustness,zhou2013percolation,hu2013percolation,gao2013percolation,dong2013robustness,radicchi2013abrupt,parandehgheibi2013robustness,danziger2013interdependent,shekhtman2014robustness,kornbluth2014cascading,shao2014robustness,watanabe2014cavity,dong2014analysis,jiang2014effect,stippinger2014enhancing,reis2014avoiding,yuan2015breadth,berezin2015localized,dong2015robustness,cheng2015cascade,radicchi2015percolation,lowinger2016interdependent,gaogao2016shell,liu2016cascading,du2016targeted,shu2017social,di2017cascading,klosik2017interdependent,roth2017emergence,cui2017cascading,fan2017robustness}, metrics that measure the critical load that a system can take before the collapse \cite{wang2015cascading,zhang2015effect,huang2015cascading,hong2015cascading}, metrics that measure the critical amount of edges to disconnect \cite{parandehgheibi2013robustness,ranjanglue}, metrics that measure how strongly coupled the interdependent networks can be \cite{gao2013percolation,shekhtman2014robustness,dong2014analysis}, metrics that measure the expected time before collapse \cite{zhang2013reliability,limiao2016reliability}, and metrics that measures the threshold at which an infection will persist on the networks for a long time \cite{sahneh2017contact}.


% time
The ``Time'' classification contains metrics that measure the time that a process takes, where this process is relevant for the robustness. Here, the duration of these processes determines how robust (or fragile) the network is under adverse scenarios. Among the reviewed articles there are metrics that measure the amount of iterations that a cascading failure takes \cite{zhou2012assortativity,hu2013percolation,zhou2013percolation,dong2013robustness,danziger2013interdependent,bashan2013extreme,zhou2014simultaneous,shekhtman2014robustness,dong2014analysis,cheng2015cascade,lee2016hybrid,di2016recovery}, the time before a user loses access to the service provided by the interdependent network system \cite{alashaikh2016supporting}, and the average delay time of the system \cite{zhang2011overlay}.


% probability
Within the ``probability'' classification, we have metrics that measure robustness according to how likely that an event is to occur, where this event is relevant for the robustness of the system. Some of these metrics measure how likely it is that a giant mutually connected component exists within the interdependent networks system \cite{buldyrev2010catastrophic,grassberger2015percolation,lee2016hybrid}, others measure how likely it is that a node is still connected to the largest connected component \cite{radicchi2015percolation,juan2017percolation}, that two nodes are connected with one another \cite{rueda2016reducing,rueda2017improving}, how likely a node is to survive a contagion \cite{min2014diversity}, or the probability that more than half of the original nodes survive \cite{korkali2017reducing}. Other metrics measure the distribution function of the largest connected cluster size \cite{lowinger2016interdependent}, or the distribution function of the load shedding \cite{cai2017modeling}. While others measure how reliable the interdependent networks are, given the probability distribution of the cascading failure size \cite{rahnamaycascading}.


% rate
The ``Rate'' classification contains metrics that measure how a specific characteristic behaves in relation to some other characteristic, such as growing rates or derivatives. Here, we found a metric that measures the amount of failed nodes per iteration of the cascading failure \cite{adler2014study}, a metric that measures the increase rate of failed nodes between consecutive iterations \cite{zhou2014simultaneous}, and a metric that is the derivative of the size of the largest connected component respect to the fraction of nodes removed of one of the networks of the interdependent network system \cite{wang2016modeling}.


% cost
Metrics on the ``cost'' classification measure how expensive it is to increase the robustness of the system \cite{qiu2013optimal,qiu2013effect,zhang2011overlay}. This can be attained by adding nodes or edges, by changing node dependencies, etc.


% path length
On the ``path length'', metrics measure how well connected the networks are, given the path lengths between nodes \cite{zhao2015cascading,chai2016resilience,sun2016impact,gong2017enhancing}. Here, the shorter the path lengths the more robust the system is considered to be.


% performance
Finally, the ``performance'' classification, as its name suggests, contains metrics that measure the performance of the interdependent network system. Here, the performances must be measured in comparison to an ideal system. In particular, what an ideal performance is will depend on the nature of the interdependent system. Only one metric was found for this classification \cite{ouyang2015resilience}.


\subsection{Studies performed by the framework}
\label{study}
Another way to characterize frameworks is by the type of studies that they perform to further understand the robustness of the interdependent network system. Besides the metrics used by the framework, each framework can perform several studies. These studies usually observe the impact of altering variables, over the robustness. From the articles reviewed, 8 main classifications were identified: ``Size of the giant connected component" (58), ``Coupling'' (54), ``Percolation'' (47), ``Targeted attacks'' (26), ``Load and capacity'' (17), ``Cascading time'' (12), ``Length'' (8), and ``Avalanche'' (8). To see the rest of the classifications found, see table \ref{studiestable}.
%Otra cualidad que caracteriza a los frameworks es el tipo de estudios que realizan para evaluar la robustez de los sistemas interdependientes, además de las métricas. Cada framework puede realizar diversos estudios donde, por ejemplo, evalúa el impacto que puede tener el alterar ciertas variables de las redes interdependientes que están siendo analizadas sobre la robustez. Según los papers analizados en este estudio se identificaron 7 clasificaciones principales:  ``tamaño de la componente gigante'' (47), ``acoplamiento'' (40), ``percolación'' (39), ``ataques intencionales'' (22),``carga y capacidad'' (15), ``Tiempo de cascada'' (10) y ``Largo de arco'' (8). Para ver el detalle de todas las clasificaciones ver la tabla \ref{studiestable}.

% size of giant component
On the ``Size of the giant connected component'' classification, we have frameworks that studied the changes on the size of the largest connected component under different conditions. This type of study can be the main focus of the framework, or complementary information of the robustness of the interdependent networks system. A total of 58 articles performed this type of study \cite{buldyrev2010catastrophic,parshani2010interdependent,zhou2012assortativity,gao2012robustness,hu2013percolation,zhou2013percolation,zhang2013reliability,schneider2013towards,bashan2013extreme,nguyen2013detecting,zhou2014simultaneous,shao2014robustness,watanabe2014cavity,jiang2014effect,reis2014avoiding,stippinger2014enhancing,ouboter2014design,tan2015robust,kotnis2015percolation,grassberger2015percolation,yuan2015breadth,dong2015robustness,li2015robust,hong2015cascading,chattopadhyay2015towards,chen2015cascading,huang2015small,zhang2015effect,huang2015cascading,cheng2015cascade,wang2016modeling,lowinger2016interdependent,ji2016improving,wang2016robustness,limiao2016reliability,zhu2016fuzzy,zhang2016cascade,liu2016cascading,sun2016impact,liu2016cascadinginner,zhao2016robustness,di2016recovery,ganin2016operational,gaogao2016shell,chai2016resilience,tang2016complex,du2016targeted,juan2017percolation,fan2017robustness,chattopadhyay2017designingbudget,chattopadhyay2017designing,wang2017preferential,cui2017cascading,panduranga2017generalized,roth2017emergence,tyra2017robustness,zhou2017overload,kazawa2017effectiveness}.


% coupling
The ``Coupling'' classification contains frameworks that studied the effect that different types of couplings have over the robustness of the system. On the interdependent networks context, the coupling refers to how are the networks coupled with one another. Usually these studies change the coupling strength, or the coupling criteria. The `coupling strength', refers to the amount of interconnections that there are between networks. While the `coupling criteria' refers to the criteria used to determine when two nodes in different networks are connected. Some coupling criteria examples are: to couple high degree nodes with low degree node nodes, to couple nodes with the same degree, to couple nodes at random, etc. A total of 54 articles performed coupling studies \cite{parshani2010interdependent,li2012cascading,ranjanglue,schneider2013towards,gao2013percolation,zhou2013percolation,dong2013robustness,bashan2013extreme,qiu2013optimal,danziger2013interdependent,shekhtman2014robustness,shao2014robustness,dong2014analysis,wang2014robustness,jiang2014effect,matsui2014modeling,reis2014avoiding,ouboter2014design,tan2015robust,kotnis2015percolation,grassberger2015percolation,chen2015cascading,hong2015cascading,dong2015robustness,li2015robust,gong2015enhancing,zhang2015effect,wang2015cascading,ji2016improving,du2016targeted,wang2016robustness,zhu2016fuzzy,zhang2016cascade,liu2016cascading,sun2016impact,liu2016cascadinginner,han2016improved,gaogao2016shell,rueda2016reducing,xia2016effect,juan2017percolation,chattopadhyay2017designingbudget,chattopadhyay2017designing,wang2017preferential,cui2017cascading,cai2017modeling,panduranga2017generalized,roth2017emergence,tyra2017robustness,zhou2017overload,korkali2017reducing,gong2017enhancing,shu2017social,fan2017robustness}.


% percolation
It is considered that a framework performed ``Percolation'' studies if it studied the percolation threshold of the system, or if it studied measures based on percolation theory \cite{stauffer1994introduction}. In the context of percolation studies, $1-p$ is the probability that a node gets disconnected from its network or fails. The percolation threshold, typically denoted by $p_c$, represents the critical value at which if $p<p_c$, then it is not possible to identify a giant connected component on the networks system. Here, the lower the $p_c$ value, the more robust the system is considered to be, as this implies a higher $1-p_c$ value. The robustness interpretation of this metric is that a lower $p_c$ means that it is possible to disconnect a higher amount of nodes before reaching the system's collapsing point. When studying the percolation of an interdependent system, first and second order phase transitions may occur. Second order phase transitions represent a continuous decay of the system where no abrupt collapse can be detected. Second order phase transitions are characteristic of single or isolated networks. First order phase transitions represent an abrupt collapse of the system as $1-p$ increases. First order phase transitions usually appear on interdependent networks systems. A total of 47 articles performed percolation studies \cite{buldyrev2010catastrophic,parshani2010interdependent,huang2011robustness,zhou2012assortativity,li2012cascading,gao2012robustness,dong2013robustness,zhou2013percolation,hu2013percolation,gao2013percolation,schneider2013towards,bashan2013extreme,danziger2013interdependent,shekhtman2014robustness,zhou2014simultaneous,kornbluth2014cascading,shao2014robustness,watanabe2014cavity,dong2014analysis,jiang2014effect,reis2014avoiding,stippinger2014enhancing,kotnis2015percolation,grassberger2015percolation,yuan2015breadth,dong2015robustness,huang2015small,radicchi2015percolation,berezin2015localized,gong2015enhancing,huang2015cascading,cheng2015cascade,lee2016hybrid,lowinger2016interdependent,di2016recovery,liu2016cascadinginner,liu2016cascading,zhu2016fuzzy,du2016targeted,shu2017social,di2017cascading,klosik2017interdependent,roth2017emergence,panduranga2017generalized,pan2017core,cui2017cascading,fan2017robustness}.


% targeted attacks / ataques intencionales
The ``Targeted attacks'' classification contains all the frameworks that test the effect of targeted attacks over the system's robustness. In this context a node or edge attack is a targeted attack if a specific parameter is used to pick the node or edge to be attacked. These attacks can pick nodes or edges using centrality measures, system values such as loads or capacities, etc. A total of 26 articles performed targeted attacks \cite{huang2011robustness,dong2013robustness,nguyen2013detecting,watanabe2014cavity,tan2015robust,cheng2015cascade,chattopadhyay2015towards,hong2015cascading,chen2015cascading,huang2015small,zhao2015cascading,wang2015cascading,zhang2015effect,chai2016resilience,xia2016effect,du2016targeted,wang2016robustness,zhang2016cascade,sun2016impact,han2016improved,rueda2016reducing,zhao2016robustness,tyra2017robustness,chattopadhyay2017designing,rueda2017improving,kazawa2017effectiveness}.


% capacity and load
``Load and capacity'' studies can be performed on frameworks that consider models where at least one of the system's networks has loads (electric, traffic, passengers, etc). These studies observe the effect of altering variables that define the load capacity of the network's nodes and edges over the robustness. In this review, a total of 17 articles performed this type of study \cite{qiu2013optimal,qiu2013effect,hong2015cascading,chen2015cascading,zhao2015cascading,huang2015cascading,wang2015cascading,zhang2015effect,tan2015robust,tang2016complex,alashaikh2016supporting,wang2016study,liu2016redundant,zhang2016cascade,xia2016effect,zhou2017overload,cai2017modeling}.


% cascading time
On the ``Cascading time'' classification, we have frameworks that study how the duration of cascading failures varies under different conditions. This type of study was performed by a total of 12 papers \cite{zhou2012assortativity,gao2012robustness,dong2013robustness,danziger2013interdependent,bashan2013extreme,zhou2014simultaneous,shekhtman2014robustness,dong2014analysis,cheng2015cascade,kotnis2015percolation,shu2017social,liu2017stochastic}.


% length
The ``Length'' classification, contains frameworks that observe the effect of changing edge lengths, over the robustness of the interdependent networks. Usually these studies are performed on articles that use models with spatial restrictions. These restrictions can be used to determine if two nodes can be connected, whether this is within the same network, or between two networks. Among the articles reviewed, 9 performed length studies \cite{li2012cascading,kornbluth2014cascading,shekhtman2014robustness,zhao2015cascading,wang2016modeling,lowinger2016interdependent,chai2016resilience,sun2016impact,gong2017enhancing}.

% avalanche

On the ``Avalanche'' classification, we have frameworks that study changes on the amount of nodes lost after an initial attack or failure, under different scenarios. This study may be performed as the main focus of the framework, or as complementary information. A total of 8 articles conducted this type of study \cite{wang2014robustness,wang2015cascading,chen2015cascading,han2016improved,liu2016redundant,lee2016hybrid,liu2017stochastic,liu2017balancing}.


\subsection{Networks used to test the framework}
\label{nework-test}
Given the requirements that an article had to satisfy in order to be considered in this survey, each article must test its framework using real or simulated networks. From the articles reviewed, only 2 classifications were identified: ``simulated'' (74), and ``real and simulated'' (28).

On the ``simulated'' classification, we have articles that only used simulated networks to test their frameworks. Some of the networks used within this category were: Erdös-Renyi, Scale-Free, and Random-Regular. A total of 74 articles used simulated networks only to test their frameworks \cite{buldyrev2010catastrophic,parshani2010interdependent,huang2011robustness,zhang2011overlay,zhou2012assortativity,li2012cascading,gao2012robustness,dong2013robustness,zhou2013percolation,hu2013percolation,gao2013percolation,radicchi2013abrupt,danziger2013interdependent,qiu2013optimal,qiu2013effect,zhang2013reliability,watanabe2014cavity,min2014diversity,shekhtman2014robustness,zhou2014simultaneous,kornbluth2014cascading,shao2014robustness,adler2014study,jiang2014effect,stippinger2014enhancing,matsui2014modeling,dong2014analysis,kotnis2015percolation,grassberger2015percolation,yuan2015breadth,tan2015robust,berezin2015localized,chen2015cascading,chattopadhyay2015towards,hong2015cascading,dong2015robustness,cheng2015cascade,zhang2015effect,wang2015cascading,huang2015cascading,lee2016hybrid,lowinger2016interdependent,tang2016complex,limiao2016reliability,wang2016robustness,du2016targeted,xia2016effect,ji2016improving,liu2016cascading,sun2016impact,liu2016cascadinginner,zhao2016robustness,liu2016redundant,han2016improved,gaogao2016shell,rueda2016reducing,rahnamaycascading,di2016recovery,juan2017percolation,sahneh2017contact,liu2017balancing,fan2017robustness,chattopadhyay2017designingbudget,chattopadhyay2017designing,liu2017stochastic,wang2017preferential,cui2017cascading,pan2017core,panduranga2017generalized,roth2017emergence,tyra2017robustness,di2017cascading,shu2017social,kazawa2017effectiveness}.


Finally, on the ``real and simulated'' classification we find frameworks that used both real and simulated networks for testing, that is, within the set of networks used for testing there is at least one network that is real, and one that is simulated. In this case, real networks may be paired with other real networks on the interdependent networks system, as in the work of Zhao et al.~\cite{zhao2015cascading} where the interconnected public transportation network is used for testing, or with simulated networks, as shown by Bashan et al.~\cite{bashan2013extreme}, where the European power-grid is coupled with a Random-Regular network. A total of 28 articles were found to belong to this classification \cite{ranjanglue,bashan2013extreme,schneider2013towards,nguyen2013detecting,parandehgheibi2013robustness,wang2014robustness,reis2014avoiding,ouboter2014design,li2015robust,ouyang2015resilience,zhao2015cascading,gong2015enhancing,huang2015small,radicchi2015percolation,chai2016resilience,wang2016study,ganin2016operational,zhang2016cascade,zhu2016fuzzy,alashaikh2016supporting,wang2016modeling,gong2017enhancing,korkali2017reducing,klosik2017interdependent,zhou2017overload,cai2017modeling,rueda2017improving,zhao2017enhancing}.
