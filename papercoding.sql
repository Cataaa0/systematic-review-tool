Different from previous works which only strive to solve this problem heuristically, this paper formulates it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). In multi-layer networks, diversity of the working and backup paths is important because a single link failure in the lower layer can result in failures of all the upper-layer links that go through it. Thus, we further strengthen the proposed ILP model by incorporating the objective of finding effective backup paths during the application request mapping process. This is achieved by exploiting the substrate topology information.  The effectiveness of the proposed ILP model is verified through extensive simulations. This novel ILP model is proved to perform significantly better in terms of QoS performance as compared to the heuristic solutions. Moreover, the proposed ILP model can provide diversified working and backup paths using few additional substrate nodes.','In this paper they talk about a substrate network (physical network) and overlay network (computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network can be thought of as being connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network). To tackle the problem \"given a substrate network with QoS and candidate information, how should one place an overlay request with QoS constraints so as to maximize the performance of the mapped overlay whilst increasing its resilience with the least substrate resources possible\" is developed in the paper an Integer Lineal Program model that can solve the overlay mapping of nodes and edges while achieving enhanced QoS and resilience performance. The ILP model is also improved to secure diversified working and backup paths allocation.

For two different attacking strategies we find that the system changes from a second-order phase transition to a first-order phase transition as coupling strength q increases. We also notice that the first-order region becomes smaller and the second-order region becomes larger as average degree or clustering coefficient increases. And, as the average supported degree approaches infinity, coupled clustered networks become independent and only the second-order transition is observed, which is similar to q = 0. Furthermore, we find that clustering coefficient has a significant impact on robustness of the system for strong coupling strength, but for weak coupling strength it has little influence, especially for attacking both networks. The study implies that we can obtain a more robust network by reducing clustering coefficient and increasing average degree for strong coupling strength. However, for weak coupling strength, a more robust network is obtained only by increasing average degree for the same support average degree. Additionally, we find that for attacking both networks the system becomes more vulnerable and difficult to defend compared to attacking only one network.','A percolation threshold study is performed for networks with different characteristics. They vary the coupling coefficient q , the clustering coefficient c, and the place in the network where the attacks are performed (network A, B or both).

As average supported degree k ̃ → ∞ (this degree is the amount of nodes that support others), coupled clustered networks become independent and behave similarly to a single clustered network.

Some findings are summarized as: (i) For random attack problem, the existence criteria for the giant component in interdependent networks coupled by two dif- ferent type networks are quite different from those coupled by the same type networks. Different type coupled networks are more vulnerable than the same type coupled-networks. (ii) For targeted attack problem, if the highly connected nodes are protected and only the lowly connected nodes failed, the system leads to a first order percolation phase transition for different type coupled-networks, and a second transition for same type coupled-networks as well.

However, the authors argue, that this is not the case in real life. So this paper compares the behavior of same type networks coupled vs different type. They also test its behaviour by protecting high or low degree nodes. They use one to one coupling and test percolation thresholds to look up the resilience of the networks under attack. It is found that: Different type coupled-networks are more vulnerable than the same type coupled-networks. Different type coupled-networks are difficult to defend by strategies such as protecting the high degree nodes.

Here, we present an interconnected network model considering cascading failures based on the dynamic redistribution of flow in the networks. Compared with the results of single scale-free networks, we find that interconnected scale-free networks have higher vulnerability. Additionally, the network heterogeneity plays an important role in the robustness of interconnected networks under intentional attacks. Considering the effects of various coupling preferences, the results show that there are almost no differences. Finally, the application of our model to the Beijing interconnected traffic network, which consists of a subway network and a bus network, shows that the subway network suffers more damage under the attack. Moreover, the interconnected traffic network may be more exposed to damage after initial attacks on the bus network. These discussions are important for the design and optimization of interconnected networks.','This paper studies flow dinamics on interconnected networks. They assume that each node in a network can manage a given amount of load and have an \"alpha\": tolerance parameter that helps to determine the load capacity. They test 3 types of coupling Random Coupling, Asortative Coupling, Dissasortative Coupling. Whenever a node is removed the load is redistributed, this may cause that some nodes become congested. When a node gets congested their counterparts in the other networks receive the overflow. This whole approach have a transpotation focus (bus - subway networks) which explains the model. In this paper 2 types of attack are tested: random and targeted to the node with the highest load. On each test it is considered that only 1 node is removed due to the attack and then the consecuent cascading failures end the attack. To measure robustness \"global efficiency is used\". The coupling kind assumed is one to one and the simulated data of networks come from ER-ER and SF-SF networks with the same amount of nodes. The real \"Traffic networks of beijing city\" are used to test the attacks too, in this case the bus and metro network are used but they don\'t have the same amount of nodes so each node of the subway network is conected to the \"corresponding\" bus station but not every bus station is connected to a subway station.

The former one happens due to the interdependence between power grid and communication networks. The latter one is caused by the load propagation in the single power grid. A tiny failure leads to the simultaneous occurrence of these two cascading failures. In this paper, we study the system robustness by considering the interdependence and load propagation. First, we develop a mathematical tool to analyze the load propagation in single network. Then, a percolation- based method is proposed to calculate the remaining fractions of survivals after the cascading failures stop. We estimate the node tolerance parameter T (the ratio of capacity to initial workload) threshold Tc′, below which the entire system may suffer from the cascading failure.The effect of interdependence on Tc′ is also studied, where lower Tc′ is required for the less compact interdependence. We prove that the system performance approaches to the upper bound once the tolerance parameter T → ∞. Our analysis indicates that the fraction of survivals in the power grid is always greater than that in communication network, although the initial failure occurs in the power grid. The extensive simulations validate our mathematical analysis, and demonstrate that the relation between the number of initial failures and tolerance parameter threshold is super-linear.','A novel framework is proposed where the model of the interdependent networks are not only subjected to the cascading failures due to the interconected nature of the network but also due to load failures (takes into account flow stuff). This work consider power and communication networks coupled together by the \"k-n\" model. Nodes in the power network have a tolerance parameter which helps determine how much load they can take. Using techniques similar to percolation threshold, they estimate the final size of the largest connected component after cascading failures.

We explore the robustness of the interdependent networks against cascading failures by two measures, i.e., the critical threshold βc quantifying the whole robustness of the interdependent networks to avoid the emergence of cascading failure, and the new proposed smallest capacity threshold βc,s quantifying the degree of the worst damage of the interdependent networks. We numerically find that the AL (high-degree nodes in network A connect high-degree ones in network B) link between two networks can greatly enhance the robust level of the interdependent networks against cascading failures. Especially we observe that the values of βc in the interdependent networks with both the DL (high-degree nodes in network A connect low-degree ones in network B) link and the RL (nodes in network A randomly connect ones in network B) link increase monotonically with the coupled strength, while the values of βc,s in the interdependent networks with three types of link patterns almost monotonically decreases with the coupled strength. In the interdependent networks with the AL,the value of βc first decreases and then increases with the coupled strength. We further explain this interesting phenomenon by a simple graph. In addition, we study the influence of the coupled strength on the efficiency of two attacks to destroy the interdependent networks. We find that, when the coupled strength between two networks is weaker, attacking the edges with the lower load is more easier to trigger the cascading propagation than attacking the nodes with the higher load, however, when the coupled strength in two networks is stronger, the case is on the contrary. Finally, we give reasonable explanations from the local perspective of the total capacity of all neighboring edges of a failed edge.','In this paper networks are considered to have load capacities, coupling strength and cascading failures due to overload. This paper focuses on attacks towards edges and the subsequent effect of this on the load of the networks. In this case if a node becomes overloaded it fails and therefore their coupled counterpart fails too, spreading the problem. If an edge fails the overload is redistributed on the same network. The aproach is a one-to-one bidirectional coupling and the nodes are coupled: High-high degrees (AL), high-low degreed (DL), random (RL). The robustness is measured in three ways: The average amount of edges lost after a cascading failure (avalanche), the beta at which the graph presents a phase transition, and the smallest capacity threshold.

The interesting result is that the coupled strength plays the different roles in three types of link patterns.

Modern systems are coupled together15–19 and there- fore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fun- damental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures (‘concurrent malfunction’) is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations20. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact ana- lytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distri- bution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.','The paper presents the situation of the 2003 blackout on Italy as a start point to develop a framework that allows the study of interdependent networks with cascading failures. First the paper explains how does their model of interdependent networks works in detail, taking into acount the steps that the interdependent network faces on a cascading failure. Then the theory of the model is explained as well as its behaviour in terms of percolation. The model is solved for some network distributions by using the generating function approach. The framework is also tested using simulations for some interconected networks where the distribution and quiantity of nodes vary.','journal'),('Centrality in social networks conceptual clarification','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',1978,'','','journal'),('Characterization and modeling of weighted networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2005,'','','journal'),('Characterization of complex networks: A survey of measurements','Taylor \\& Francis','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Classes of small-world networks','NAS','not-in-selection',2000,'','','journal'),('Cluster structure near the percolation threshold','IOP','not-in-selection',1982,'','','journal'),('Collective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networks','nature','not-in-selection',1998,'','','journal'),('Combinatorial landscapes','SIAM','not-in-selection',2002,'','','journal'),('Communication and correlation among communities','APS','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Community structure and ethnic preferences in school friendship networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Complex network clustering by multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimization based on decomposition','IEEE','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Complex networks, vol. 650','Springer','not-in-selection',2004,'','','misc'),('Complex networks: A winning strategy','nature','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Complex networks: structure and dynamics','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2006,'','','journal'),('Complex networks: structure, robustness and function','CUP','not-in-selection',2010,'','','book'),('Complex networks: The fragility of interdependency','NPG','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),('Complex systems analysis of series of blackouts: Cascading failure, critical points, and self-organization','AIP','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Complexity of coupled human and natural systems','AAAS','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Component criticality in failure cascade processes of network systems','WOL','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Computers and intractability','WHFreemanNY','not-in-selection',2002,'','','book'),('Computing global structural balance in large-scale signed social networks','NAS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Concepts in thermal physics','OUP Oxford','not-in-selection',2009,'','','book'),('Conditions for viral influence spreading through multiplex correlated social networks','APS','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Conficker C analysis','SRIInt','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Contact-based social contagion in multiplex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Controllability of complex networks','nature','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Coordinated scheduling of electricity and natural gas infrastructures with a transient model for natural gas flow','AIP','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Correlated couplings and robustness of coupled networks','arXiv','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),('Coupled behavior analysis with applications','IEEE','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),('Critical Cascading Failures in Interdependent Networks: Non Mean-Field Behavior','arXiv','not-in-selection',2012,'','','preprint'),('Critical effect of dependency groups on the function of networks','NAS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Critical load and congestion instabilities in scale-free networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2003,'','','journal'),('Critical phenomena in complex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2008,'','','journal'),('Cross-layer survivability in WDM-based networks','IEEE','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Data mining with big data','IEEE','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Decreasing the spectral radius of a graph by link removals','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Design and evolution of modular neural network architectures','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',1994,'','','journal'),('Design of Robust Dependent Networks against Flow-based Cascading Failures','IEEE','7014931',2014,'In this paper we propose strategies to increase the robustness of a communication network which depends on the proper functioning of an electricity network.

[1], we use a more realistic model of the electricity network by taking the essential characteristics of the power flow into account, instead of considering purely the topological structure. The effect of the flow-based cascading failures originating from the electrical grid, on the communication network is studied, where the coupling between those networks plays an important role. We have computed the performanceof our proposed selection strategies by averaging over many configurations of communication networks, which are modelled both as scale-free networks and as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, applied to an electricity network formed by the IEEE 118  bus test system. We show that a hybrid strategy, based on the degree of the communication nodes and the failure probabilities of the electricity nodes, give a significant improvement over a random selection strategy, as well as over other strategies we proposed. Our method is also tested on a real-world interdependent network: the high voltage electricity grid in Italy coupled with a communication network, inspired by the Italy blackout in 2003.','This paper treat the topic of communication-power grid networks taking into account flow dynamics on the electric network and a one directional coupling model. Here is stated that the power grid does not depend on the standar communication network but rather on its own SCADA network and that communication network does depend on the electricity network. In order to design a more robust network, since is too expensive to redesign a network they propose to have some communication nodes decoupled by making them self suficient. They too say that this can be done just for some nodes due to the costs involved. On this model they use equations to simulate the flow of energy through the electricity network, whenever a node exceeds or lower its flow enough it becomes non-functional. In this paper several \'robusting\' strategies are proved (1.-The reference scenario, where no nodes are autonomous.2.-Nodes from the communication network or electricity network are chosen uniformly random.3.-Nodes with the highest degree in the electricity network are chosen.5.-Nodes with the lowest degree in the electricity network are chosen.6.-Nodes with the highest probability to fail in the electricity network are chosen.7.-Linear hybrid of strategy 3 and 6.7.-Non-linear hybrid of strategy 3 and 6), being the hybrid strategies (degree + probability of collapse) the most effective at improving the robustness of the coupled system against random attacks.','proceedings'),('Designing and embedding reliable virtual infrastructures','ACM','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Designing resilient networks using a hybrid genetic algorithm approach','ACM','not-in-selection',2005,'','','proceedings'),('Designing survivable resilient networks: a stochastic hybrid genetic algorithm approach','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Detecting Critical Nodes in Interdependent Power Networks for Vulnerability Assessment','IEEE','6407159',2013,'Power networks and information systems become more and more interdependent to ensure better supports for the functionality as well as improve the economy.

Therefore, the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND) optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an in- terdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of ￼ (2 - epsilon). Despite its intractability, we propose a greedy framework with novel centrality functions based on the networks’ interdependencies, to efficiently solve this problem in a timely manner.

We find that when two networks with similar sizes are coupled, the interconnected networks are the most fragile for sparse coupling while they are the most robust for dense coupling.

Characteristics of the model presented in this framework are: there can be a transference of traffic between networks through the interlinks, the coupling is assortative by load order or random depending on the case tested. In this framework the load that each node can take is given by their inicial betweennes centrality pondered by a factor of (1+alfa).

We also provide a theoretical approach which correctly predicts the relationship between rc and q. We also examine the dynamics at the percolation threshold pc for varying r and q and find that there are three different mechanisms of failure for every q depending on r. Below rc the system undergoes a continuous transition similar to standard percolation. Above rc there are two distinct first-order transitions for finite or infinite r, respectively.The transition for finite r is characterized by spreading of node failures through the system while the infinite r corresponds to a non-spatial cascading failure similar to the case of random networks.

Here, we study a general model of spatially embedded networks with dependencies under localized attacks. We develop a theoretical and numerical approach to describe and predict the effects of localized attacks on spatially embedded systems with dependencies. Surprisingly, we find that a localized attack can cause substantially more damage than an equivalent random attack. Furthermore, we find that for a broad range of parameters, systems which appear stable are in fact metastable.Though robust to random failures—even of finite fraction—if subjected to a localized attack larger than a critical size which is independent of the system size (i.e., a zero fraction), a cascading failure emerges which leads to complete system collapse.','This paper proposes an approach to describe and predict the effects of localized attacks on spatially embedded systems with dependencies. To do so 2D \'diluted\' lattices with edge length constraints are considered to represent interdimentional networks. It is found that there are 3 possible states : stable, metastable, unestable when under \"local attacks\". A local attack is one that is centered on a node and affects nodes (destroys them) on a specific radius. Interdependent lattices are stable if under any radius of attack  (infinite) they don\'t collapse, metastable if under a certain attack radius is stable but above that radius it collapses and unestable if even a zero radius attacks makes the networks collapse. This work presents a complete analytical and simulation results to identify the interdependent lattice state. The results are in great concordance with the expected results from the analitycal part. IIt showed that local attacks bounded to \'physical\' radius can be catastrophic in a wide range of cases (interconected networks) while on a single lattice the local attack might not have an effect at all.

The degree-based weighting scheme was extended to interdependent networks, with the flow dynamics dominated by global redistribution based on weighted betweenness centrality. Through contingency analysis of one-node removal, we demonstrated that there still exists an optimal weighting parameter on interdependent networks, but it might shift as compared to the case in isolated networks because of the break of symmetry. And it will be easier for the symmetrically and asymmetrically coupled interdependent networks to achieve robustness and better cost configuration against the one-node-removal-induced cascade of load failures when coupling strength was weaker. Our findings might have great generality for characterizing load-failure-induced cascading dynamics in real-world degree-based weighted interdependent networks.','This paper studies de Global load-based redistribution by assigning the load through intra-degree and inter-degree properties. The robustness is measured by removing each node once and re-adjusting the capacities of the nodes to take the load of the one node removal without falling apart.

With this the optimal weighting parameter (thetha*) is the one resulting in the minimum investment (I1*).

Whereas theoretical methods of direct applicability to real isolated networks exist, the frameworks developed so far in percolation theory for interdependent network layers are of little help in practical contexts, as they are suited only for special models in the limit of infinite size. Here, we introduce a set of heuristic equations that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these systems into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a smooth percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in small networks. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing cores of ‘high quality’ edges to prevent catastrophic failures.','This paper proposes a method to satudy the percolation thresholds of complex coupled networks. It recognizes problems on the assumptions of previous model (the graph models topology is not specified by a one-zero adjacency matrix, they\'re applied to infinitely large systems) that real interconnected networks don\'t possess. Then a methodology to describe percolation transitions is explained. By defining several concepts and steps the paper arrives to an euristic equation for the probability that a node i is in the largest mutually connected cluster of the system. They determine that the percolation transition depends on size of the intersection of the graph vs the remainder. The method is tested by comparing empyrical results against the theoretical results obtained from the heuristic equation. One thing apreciated is that in heterogeneous graphs the nature of transition is not determined by the number of edges shared across the layers but their quality. The results of the theoretical and empyrical results are very similar concluding that the framework is able to help identify cores of quality links that can prevent catastrophic failures in real systems.','journal'),('Percolation in self-similar networks','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Percolation of a general network of networks','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Percolation of interdependent networks with intersimilarity','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Percolation of localized attack on complex networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2015,'','','journal'),('Percolation of partially interdependent networks under targeted attack','APS','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),('Percolation of partially interdependent scale-free networks','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Percolation on dense graph sequences','IMS','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),('Percolation on interacting networks','arXiv','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Percolation on interacting, antagonistic networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Percolation on sparse networks','APS','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Percolation theory applied to measures of fragmentation in social networks','APS','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Percolation theory on interdependent networks based on epidemic spreading','IOP','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),('Percolation transitions are not always sharpened by making networks interdependent','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Performance analysis of complex networks and systems','CUP','not-in-selection',2014,'','','book'),('Performance and reliability of electrical power grids under cascading failures','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Perspectives on risk management in supply chains','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('PlanetLab project','ONLINE','not-in-selection',2030,'','','ONLINE'),('Power-law distributions in empirical data','SIAM','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Preferential attachment in the interaction between dynamically generated interdependent networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),('Proactive robustness control of heterogeneously loaded networks','APS','not-in-selection',2006,'','','journal'),('Probabilistic study of cascading failures in complex interdependent lifeline systems','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Promoting collective motion of self-propelled agents by distance-based influence','APS','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Protecting infrastructure networks from cost-based attacks','IOP','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('QoSMap: achieving quality and resilience through overlay construction','IEEE','not-in-selection',2009,'','','proceedings'),('QoSMap: QoS aware mapping of virtual networks for resiliency and efficiency','IEEE','not-in-selection',2007,'','','proceedings'),('Random Graphs','Springer','not-in-selection',1985,'','','journal'),('Random graphs containing arbitrary distributions of subgraphs','APS','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),('Random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions and their applications','APS','not-in-selection',2001,'','','journal'),('Random graphs with clustering','APS','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Random walks on complex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2004,'','','journal'),('Reaction--diffusion processes and metapopulation models in heterogeneous networks','nature','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),('Recent development on supply chain supernetwork modeling','Shanghai.LD','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Recovering from disruptions of interdependent critical infrastructures','-','not-in-selection',2001,'','','proceedings'),('Recovery from malicious transactions','IEEE','not-in-selection',2002,'','','journal'),('Reflection on supernetwork','Shanghai.LD','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Reliability Analysis of Interdependent Networks Using Percolation Theory','IEEE','6727252',2013,'Many complex systems have functional interde- pendency between each other and can be modeled as interdepen- dent networks.

In this paper, we propose a novel interdependent network model which consists of two individual networks with unequal numbers of nodes and one-to-multiple weighted dependency links between the two networks. Based on realistic assumptions, this model differs from previous works that considered equal numbers of nodes in the two networks and identical dependency links. We formulate an optimization problem to allocate dependency links using least resources. This novel model enhances the practicability of traditional cyber–physical system structures, but it makes the dependency link deployment problem more complex and the optimization problem cannot be solved in large networks. To overcome this problem, we propose a new algorithm based on a revised network flow method. Extensive simulations on random networks and real networks show that our deployment method produces topologies that are more robust than the ones obtained by other deployment techniques. Results indicate that our algorithm is efficient and cost-effective in designing robust interdependent networks, and our deployment method is suitable for networks of any size.','This paper tackles the problem of allocating links (dependency links that connect 2 different networks in particular) given that each one have a cost and there\'s a budget (a limit to the amount of link you can afford). Here, as in other papers, the biggest connected component is the one that\'s considered functional. However they propose a one-to-multiple dependence over networks that are no neccesarily the same one or have the same amount of nodes (Although for simulation pourposes they couple networks with the same \"structure\"). For a node to properly function it has to be connected to the largest connected component and have at least one dependency link. The robustness metric they use is the average value of the size of the largest connected component divided by the original size of the network for each network. The allocation process is divided on 2 steps. The first one is Basic connectivity to ensure that every node has at least one dependency link (you need max(Na,Nb) links). The second step is the augmented connectivity, here the remaining budget is use according to some strategy. The authors say that \"the aim of augmented connectivity is to achieve minimum variance of node degree\" (for better robustness). To perform the tests they use 2 strategies \"maximize the number of dependencies\" and \"random\" on ER networks coupled (they did not use the same network, they have differen sizes Nb=(1+a)Na).','journal'),('Robust-yet-fragile nature of interdependent networks','APS','not-in-selection',2015,'','','journal'),('Robustness analysis of static routing on networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Robustness envelopes of networks','Oxford Un.','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Robustness in simple biochemical networks','nature','not-in-selection',1997,'','','journal'),('Robustness measure for power grids with respect to cascading failures','ITC','not-in-selection',2011,'','','proceedings'),('Robustness of a network formed by n interdependent networks with a one-to-one correspondence of dependent nodes','APS','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),('Robustness of a network of networks','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Robustness of a partially interdependent network formed of clustered networks','APS','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Robustness of complex networks with the local protection strategy against cascading failures','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Robustness of interdependent and interconnected clustered networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Robustness of interdependent networks under several intentional attack strategies','Shanghai.LD','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),('Robustness of interdependent networks under targeted attack','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Robustness of Interdependent Networks: The case of communication networks and the power grid','IEEE','6831395',2013,'We study the robustness of interdependent networks, in which the state of one network depends on the state of the other network and vice versa. In particular, we focus on the interdependency between the power grid and communication networks, where the grid depends on communications for its control, and the communication network depends on the grid for power. A real-world example is the Italian blackout of 2003, when a small failure in the power grid cascaded between the two networks and led to a massive blackout. In this paper, we study the minimum number of node failures needed to cause total blackout (i.e., all nodes in both networks to fail).In the case of unidirectional interdependency between the networks we show that the problem is NP-hard, and develop heuristics to find a near-optimal solution. On the other hand, we show that in the case of bidirectional interdependency this problem can be solved in polynomial time. We believe that this new interdependency model gives rise to important, yet unexplored, robust network design problems for interdependent networked infrastructures.','In this paper the authors analyze the robustness of interdependent networks where the interdependencies are manifested 2 ways. For each way they want to know the minimum number of node failures needed to cause total blackout. They focus on the example of SCADA-Power grid dependencies. The first case considered is the unidirectional dependency case where if a router node depends on a certain power node it doesn\'t mean that power node depends on that router node. The second case is the one to one dependency where if one of the coupled nodes fails the other fails as well. The former case is proven to be an NP-complete problem so heuristics to tackle it are given, while the latter case is a polynomial problem. The tests are performed over star like networks to measure the effects of the interdependencies on the cascading failures and those effects only (star like means that, for ex., on the power grid every node is connected to the generator and generators can function by themselves).

Besides widely used metric giant component, we study small cluster (small component) in interdependent networks after cascading failures occur. We first introduce an overview on how small clusters distribute in various single networks. Then we propose a percolation theory based mathematical method to study how small clusters be affected by the interdependence between two coupled networks. We prove that the upper bounds exist for both the fraction and the number of operating small clusters. Without loss of generality, we apply both synthetic network and real network data in simulation to study small clusters under different interdependence models and network topologies. The extensive simulations highlight our findings: except the giant component, considerable proportion of small clusters exists, with the remaining part fragmenting to very tiny pieces or even massive isolated single vertex; no matter how the two networks are tightly coupled, an upper bound exists for the size of small clusters. We also discover that the interdependent small-world networks generally have the highest fractions of operating small clusters. Three attack strategies are compared: Inter Degree Priority Attack, Intra Degree Priority Attack and Random Attack. We observe that the fraction of functioning small clusters keeps stable and is independent from the attack strategies.','Here a different view on the robustness measurements is shown. The authors say that measuring the largest connected component and assuming that a node that\'s not connected to it is non operational is wrong. Instead they propose to take into account the amount of small clusters that remain functional after an attack. A node remains operational if it is connected to a cluster with a minimum size delta and it is interconnected. They also propose an alternative to the one to one coupling that they call \"k-n\", in this coupling they have unidirectional links and two types of nodes (one connects with k other nodes, the other with n). They show that the semaller the delta the more robust is the network. And that it is necessary to take small clusters (that are functional) into account in order to properly evaluate network robustness.','journal'),('Small worlds: the dynamics of networks between order and randomness','PUP','not-in-selection',1999,'','','book'),('Smart grid communications and networking','CUP','not-in-selection',2012,'','','book'),('Spatial networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Spatially localized attacks on interdependent networks: the existence of a finite critical attack size','arXiv','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Spectra of random graphs with given expected degrees','NAS','not-in-selection',2003,'','','journal'),('Spectral graph theory','AMS','not-in-selection',1997,'','','book'),('Spectral measure of structural robustness in complex networks','IEEE','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Spectral redemption in clustering sparse networks','NAS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Spin glass theory and beyond.','WSP','not-in-selection',1990,'','','journal'),('Spontaneous recovery in dynamical networks','nature','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),('Spread of epidemic disease on networks','APS','not-in-selection',2002,'','','journal'),('Spreading dynamics in complex networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Spreading of cooperative behaviour across interdependent groups','nature','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),('Stability and topology of scale-free networks under attack and defense strategies','APS','not-in-selection',2005,'','','journal'),('Statistical mechanics of complex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2002,'','','journal'),('Statistical physics of social dynamics','APS','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Structural vulnerability of power systems: A topological approach','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),('Structural vulnerability of the North American power grid','APS','not-in-selection',2004,'','','journal'),('Structure of shells in complex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),('Study of the Use of a Genetic Algorithm to Improve Networked System-of-Systems Resilience','ScienceDirect','Study-of-the-use',2014,'Large scale failures or degradation resulting from smaller initial failures or disruptions in networked system-of- systems are an issue in multiple areas - for example cascading failures in electrical power grids or large disruptions in national air traffic due to local or regional weather conditions.

In a limited range of weighting parameters, degree-based weighting scheme outweigh clustering-based scheme. Outside of that range, clustering-based weighting scheme outweigh degree-based scheme.

Each subnetwork grows through the addition of new nodes with constant accelerating random attachment in the first model but with preferential attachment in the second model. The two subnetworks interact with multi-support and undirectional dependence links. The effects of dependence relations and strength between subnetworks are analyzed in the percolation behavior of fully interdependent networks against random failure, both theoretically and numerically, and as a result, for both relations: interdependent SF networks show a second-order percolation phase transition and the increased dependence strength decreases the robustness of the system, whereas, interdependent ER networks show the opposite results. In addition, the power-law relation between networks yields greater robustness than the exponential one at the given dependence strength.','In this paper they present a simple framework but with 2 different models possible. To resume: once the network is modeled they test the resilience by measuring the percolation threshold for each initial p. The models are constructed on steps where nodes and links are added. There are two types of links: connectivity links (intra) and dependency links (inter). The first model begins with m0 nodes and n0 connectivity links on each network (A and B), on each step t it add a node to every network. Each node in A adds mA links, it attaches itself with a 1-qa fraction of nodes in the same network through connectivity links. The rest of the links are dependency links who are attached to nodes in B. (For each node in B is the same). The second model is initiated in the same way but when the nodes are added on each network and on each step t the link addition it\'s done by the constant acceleration scenario. Given the new node in A, this scenario adds a connectivity link between 2 nodes in A with probability s, it must be satisfied that the expected amount of links is st. In the case of the addition of dependency links they can be added at random or preferentially (DL) (exponenctial dependence-degree dist or power-law-degree dist.).  This second model ends up creating a ER network with poisson degree distribution. The tests performed study the percolation threshold pc for different q (level of dependence), and the sizes of the largest connected components depending on p (the cascading process begins by removing 1-p nodes from network A). A node is considered functional if it belongs to the largest connected component and has at leats 1 dependency link.

Above a critical fraction of interdependent nodes, even a single node failure can invoke cascading failures that may abruptly fragment the system, whereas below this critical dependency a failure of a few nodes leads only to a small amount of damage to the system. So far, research has focused on interdependent random networks without space limitations. However, many real systems, such as power grids and the Internet, are not random but are spatially embedded. Here we analytically and numerically study the stability of interdependent spatially embedded networks modelled as lattice networks. Surprisingly, we find that in lattice systems, in contrast to non-embedded systems, there is no critical dependency and any small fraction of interdependent nodes leads to an abrupt collapse. We show that this extreme vulnerability of very weakly coupled lattices is a consequence of the critical exponent describing the percolation transition of a single lattice.','The paper begins explaining that not all networks are random and that in many cases these are spatially embedded. In order to study the effects of this kind of structure they use percolation theory and lattice graphs, though they acknowlodge that most of these networks are not lattices. In this paper they show the theory using interdependent networks composed by two networks. It is focused on the case where both networks have the same degree distribution. With this they proceed to analyze the size of the giant component at criticality in function of the coupling strenght q, for this, they used different simulated and real networks coupled together. It concludes that for spatially embedded networks even a weak coupling lead to a relatively large-scale collapse while for random networks the discontinuity size does not have a singular point.

In particular, we study the propagation of a SIS model on interdependent networks where the state of each node is layer-independent and the dynamics in each network follows either a contact process or a reactive process, with different propagation rates. We apply this study to the case of existing interdependent networks, namely a Spanish scientific community of Statistical Physics, formed by a social network of scientific collaborations and a physical network of connected computers in each institution.

This paper develops a new formalism that applies to the study of the epidemic spreading in these kind of systems. The idea is to take into account the contagion process.

The contagion patern is measured over time considering the probability of get infected or the probability of recovery. The robustness of the network is measured through the density of infected nodes. They test their proposal using the Spanish Statistical Physics networks, 2 layers are defined: physical and social. On each layer the authors are nodes. On the physical layer the links represent that they belong to the same university and department or that they belong to the same research center. On the social network the links represent collaboration between authors. The experiments were averaged over 200 realizations and they all start with the network fully infected.

We consider load propagation via connectivity links as node failure spreads through one layer of an interdependent network, and we develop a priority redistribution strategy for failed loads subject to flow constraint. Using a giant component function and a one-to-one directed interdependence relation between nodes in a cyber-layer network and physical-layer network, we construct time-varied functional equations to quantify the dynamic process of failed loads propagation in an interdependent network. Finally, we conduct a numerical simulation for two cases, i.e., single node removal and multiple node removal at the initial disruption.

Understanding the robustness of NON with interdependent and interconnected links is helpful to design resilient infrastructures. Here we develop a framework to study analytically and numerically the robustness of this system with no-feedback and feedback conditions for the case of starlike NON. When assumed that all degree distributions of the connectivity intra and inter-links are Poissonian, we find that the system undergoes from second order through hybrid order to first order phase transition as coupling strength q increases. Additionally, for both conditions, the results suggest that increasing density of connectivity links (intra-connectivity links or inter-connectivity links) can increase the robustness of the system, while the interdependency links decrease its robustness. Furthermore, by comparing critical attacking strength under same parameters for both conditions, we also find that feedback condition of dependency links, in contrast to no-feedback condition, makes the system extremely vulnerable.

The percolation threshold is typically denoted by p_c and where p_c represent the critical value of p. In this context 1-p represents the probability of a node of failing or get disconnected. Thus, p_c is the point where no giant component remains (mayor failure of the network). The smaller the value of p_c the more robust is the network (this implies a bigger 1-p_c value and therefore that is necessary to disconnect more nodes to destry the network). When studying percolation phase transitions can be identified, these may be first or second order phase transitions.
