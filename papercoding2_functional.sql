The client layer is connected via UNIs (User Network Interface) to the OTN (Optical Transport Network). The control planes of both layers exchange no information (overlay model) or only sparse information (augmented model) about the current routing and resource usage. The client layer can request new link capacities on demand from the OTN-provider dynamically, using the UNI. Thus, the main concept of the client is to adjust the link resources automatically and cost-efficiently depending on the current demand.'),(3,'overlay model','There is a substrate network considered fixed (physical), a logical topology (logic) and on top of that there\'s the overlay network or overlay mapping. Overlay mapping is defined here as the process of mapping an application request to a substrate network whilst satisfying the specific requirements of the application. '),(4,'compressed one to one','This model takes the same kind of interactions as a one-to-one model but compresses the 2two networks into one network that captures the behaviour of the original coupled pair. Here if 2 nodes av in N1 and u in N2 are interconected, in the compressed version will be represented as uxv and any edge that u or v had will remain. In this model, unlike one to one, there can be uncoupled nodes. In this compressed network is direct that if a node fails its interdependent node also fails.'),(5,'one to one weighted','The interactions are equal to the one to one model. There are two networks inter-connected. Each node of each network is inter-connected with exactly one node in the other network. If a node fails the corresponding part also fails. The number of nodes in each network is the same. The inter and intra interactions are bidirectional (non-directed). Each node, intra and inter-edge have a weight. If 1-t is the probability that one node in network A fails, then the probability that one edge in network A is present is equal to t*t. For the inter-edge case the probability is t since it only depends on a node of network A not failing. Only nodes in network A can fail.'),(6,'multiple support-dependence with load','This model describe relations between networks where a node in one network depends on one or more nodes in the other network. This dependence is unidirectional. The dependent node must have at least one support node in order to function. Nodes and links have weight and nodes have capacities. Here there are flows of packages from (to) each node and if a node fails then the load is redistributed by the new weight of each node and link. The weight of links is given as a function of intra-degree or inter-degree of the nodes connected by the link. The inter-degree of a node is given by the amount of nodes on the other network that support it. The weight/load of a node corresponds to the betweenness centrality of the node since each package uses the shortest path.'),(7,'Spatial one to one','The interactions between networks are the same as in the one to one model (bidirectional dependence). Inside the network links are non directed too. In this model not all the nodes of a network are necessarily connected. There is a \'distance\' between nodes given by the \'length\' of the link. This length exist thanks to the spatial embedding of the network (nodes have spatial coordinates). Two nodes acan get inter-connected (1 node in net. A 1 node in net. B) only if they are at a distance of at most r. If r=0 then the case is that of a single network and if r=inf then the interconnections aare simply usual connections at random.'),(8,'one to one with lifetime','There are two networks inter-connected. Each node of each network is inter-connected with exactly one node in the other network. If a node fails the corresponding part also fails. The number of nodes in each network is the same. The inter and intra interactions are bidirectional (non-directed). The components have a \'lifetime\' after which they begin to fail. The overall interdependent network  also has a lifetime. The interdependent-network lifetime is given by the time where \'\'criticality is reached\'\' (destruction/p_c).'),(9,'unidiectional bipartite PG-CCN','This model considers 2 interdependent networks that don\'t posses intra-intercations. The networks specifically represent the Power Grid network (PG) and the Control and Communication Network (CCN). On the PG there are Generators and Substations but only substations conform the actual models since it\'s assumed that each substation is connected to the generator and to cut an edge is equal to say that the subst. node failed. On the CCN there are Control Centers and Routers, the case is analogous to the PG. Here the dependencies between subst. and routers may be multiple and are unidirectional.'),(10,'bidirectional bipartite PG-CCN','This model considers 2 interdependent networks that don\'t posses intra-intercations.

On the CCN there are Control Centers and Routers, the case is analogous to the PG. Here the dependencies between subst. and routers may be multiple and are biderctional.'),(11,'non-exclusive one to one','This model present the same interactions and type of cascading failures as the one to one model. Except that in this case each node may be interconnected with one or more nodes in the other network. A node remains functional if it is connected to the largest connected component and if at least one of its inter-dependent nodes is functional.'),(12,'one to one with load','There are two networks inter-connected. Each node of each network is inter-connected with exactly one node in the other network. If a node fails the corresponding part also fails. The number of nodes in each network is the same. This model in particular manages loads of some sort. Each component has a capacity defined either by characteristics of it or of the entity being modeled.'),(13,'state-interdependent network','In this kind of model there are no explicit links between layers. On each layer there\'s a standard network with nodes and links. Each nodes is in some \'state\'. Nodes with the same label in different layers share the same state, if the state of a node changes in some layer then it changes in every layer. Here each layer have the same amount of nodes. This model may be used to study contagion processes by defining a contagion matrix for each layer.'),(14,'PG-SCADA','There is a Power Grid network and a SCADA network (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition). The PG network has root nodes that model a substation that provides power electricity through the power line network. The SCADA nodes represents either a router for communication line or a slave station that is equipped with a sensor (router node, sensor node). A sensor node is attached to every router node. The root node for SCADA models a server computer that monitors the system. Every node has exactly one inter-link (dependency link) with bidirectional dependency. The PG provides power to the SCADA and the PG is monitored by the SCADA. Intra net intercations are directed. If a PG link fails the subnet can\'t have energy. If a SCADA link fails the subnet can\'t be observed. If a sensor node fails it can\'t observe or control. A router fails if its PG node is not working.'),(15,'NON connectivity-dependency links','(Network of Networks) this model may contain N networks. These networks can be coupled by dependency links and connectivity links. A fraction q_ji is connected through dependency links. If q=1 then the networks are fully dependent. The connectivity links are the usual links that can connect a node to the largest connected component. A node is functional if its connected to some giant component (even in another network). This model may or not have feedback conditon, the no-feedback condition means that the dependency of 2 nodes is bidirectional (aj -> bi y bi -> ah => ah=aj). '),(16,'unidirectional PG-SCADA','There is a Power Grid network and a SCADA network (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition). The PG network may suffer cascading failures due to overload in links but it does not depend on the SCADA net. If a node in the SCADA net fails nothing happens. If a node in the PG net stops  working or produces less energy than the minimum requiered by its dependent SCADA node, that SCADA node fails. Interactions between networks are unidirectional. The SCADA network depends on the PG, not the other way around. No 2 SCADA nodes depend on the same PG node and each SCADA node depends on one PG node. The PG network works with loads and the loads are redistributed in case of failure. A SCADA node also fails if it is no longer connected to the largest connected component.'),(17,'multiple support-dependence','This model describe relations between networks where a node in one network depends on one or more nodes in the other network. This dependence is unidirectional. The dependent node must have at least one support node in order to function and must belong to the giant component of functional nodes in the network it belongs to.'),(18,'supply-chain','This model presents a physical-layer and a cyber-layer. The physical-layer is composed by vertices, edges, load constraints for links, initial load of nodes and load constraints for nodes (V,E,W,L,C). In this layer the links are directed since they represent the chain supplier, mannufacterer, distributor and costumer. In case of failure the load propagates through the directed connections. The node capacity is usually related with the cost. In the case of the cyber-layer the tuple (V,E,L,W,C) represents the node, undirected links, and the analogous of the physical-layer (in this casee data-loads and hubs are being modelled). The dependencies between the 2 networks are \'one to one\' and reciprocal.'),(19,'load transfer','Here there are 2 interconnected networks. Each have capacities, weights and loads (nodes/links). When a node fails, its load  is transferred to the rest of the network. The overload produced on the network (as a node failed its overall capacity is reduced) is tranferred to the other network and it continues until a steady state is reached. In this model each node is connected to exactly one node in the other network, the amount of possible connections is given by the network with the least number of nodes. (if both networks have the same number of nodes, then each node in each network has one interlink). All links are undirected.'),(20,'k-n with load','There are 2 networks Gp (power-grid) and Gc (communication network). In Gc there are 2 types of nodes information relays and control nodes. Control nodes monitor and operate nodes in Gp. Each control node takes care of n Gp nodes and each Gp node is watched by k control nodes. Nodes in Gp also provide energy to the nodes in Gc. The amount of nodes in Gc that a node in Gp takes care of is given bya a modified version of balls and bins that takes into account the capacity of the nodes in Gp. Gp has loads and capacity. If a node in Gp fails the load is tranferred to the rest of Gp uniformly to the neighbors of the removed node. An overloaded node fails. The inter-links are directed and named \'control-dependency links\' and Energy-dependency links.'),(21,'k-n','There are 2 networks Gp (power-grid) and Gc (communication network). In Gc there are 2 types of nodes information relays and control nodes. Control nodes monitor and operate nodes in Gp. Each control node takes care of n Gp nodes and each Gp node is watched by k control nodes. Nodes in Gp also provide energy to the nodes in Gc. The amount of nodes in Gc that a node in Gp takes care of is given by a balls and bins.'),(22,'IP/MPLS over WDM','This model considers a standar telecommunications network. Here the WDM or optical network is composed by routers and their routing. IP/MPLS layer requires this network to communicate. If a router fails the dependent node in the other networks gets rerouted. If there is no re-routing possible it also fails. Interaction are bidirectional inside each network and unidirectional (Ip depends on optical) inter network.'),(23,'immediate load transfer','There are 2 interconnected networks. The nodes have loads and capacities. Neworks are inter-connected through interconnected links thar allow load transfer. If a node fail the load of each node is recalculated, if a node is overloaded then it is removed. This process continues until the system is stable. A node is considered functional if it belongs to the largest connected component. When recalculating the loads nodes in both networks are considered (immediate load transfer inter-network).'),(24,'at most one to one','There are two networks inter-connected. Each node of each network is inter-connected with at most one node in the other network. If a node fails the corresponding part also fails. The inter and intra interactions are bidirectional (non-directed). A node is considered functional if it belongs to the largest connected component.'),(25,'Inter-Dependent Markov Chain (IDMC) model','provides a probabilistic framework to capture the effects of interdependencies among physical networks on the stochastic dynamics of cascading failures in an abstract setting.'),(29,'overlay model with spine','There is a substrate network considered fixed (physical), a logical topology (logic) and on top of that there\'s the overlay network or overlay mapping. Overlay mapping is defined here as the process of mapping an application request to a substrate network whilst satisfying the specific requirements of the application.\r\n\r\n\"We consider a two layer network composed of the physical network on the bottom represented as GP with the set of nodes and links (VP , EP ), and on top the logical network GL represented by the set of logical nodes and links (VL , EL ). We assume that each logical node is connected to its corresponding physical node (i.e., VL = VP ).\"\r\n\r\n\"(...) the Spine concept, a subnetwork structure embedded at the physical layer with higher availability.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also loads and capacities of traffic.'),(30,'Cyber-Physical Power System','There\'s the cyber layer and a physical layer from the power system.  The physical layer is the power grid, it is undirected and have weights (loads) W. The elements of W are the electrical distances between two ends of the edges and equal to the reciprocal of the reactance of the corresponding edges, w = x−1 , where i and j ij ij are the two ends of the edge . The cyber layer represents the control network and is an unidrected graph. Interactions inter-network are directed. To be functional a node must \'receive\' (in-degree) at least one link and belong to the largest connected component. When a node is disconnected from the physical layer some links may fail due to overload and the network must verify if their power needs are satisfied.'),(31,'multiplex model','Multiplex network have nodes that appear in 2 or more layers but are \"the same\". Delete a multiplex node removes al layers while deleting a layer does not affect the other layers of the node. The giant component naturally consists of a set of connected multiplex nodes. A pair of multiplex nodes are regarded to have connection if there exists at least one type of link between them. Therefore, attacking some layer nodes may not destroy their connection with other nodes, and the set of nodes that remains at the end of damage is the mutually connected giant component.  '),(32,'innerdependency/interdependency links','Each node can have a dependency link and use it to connect itself with a node on its own network or on the other network. There are also non-directed without interaction links for the inner network connection. The dependency link means that the two nodes connected by it depend on each other, one of which fails, the other will fail too. Specifically, a fraction β of the dependency links are set as the inter-dependency links, others are the inner-dependency links. For inter-dependency links, the two stubs (nodes) are chosen randomly in the two net- works, respectively, and in the same networks for inner-dependency links. When β → 0, there is no dependency between the two networks and the model will reduce to the model of the single network with dependency link density q = 1 in ref. 28. When β → 1, our model will reduce to the original model of interdependent network proposed in ref4 (Buldyrev one to one).'),(33,'probabilistic one to one','If a node fails its dependent neighbour will lose their connectivity links with a certain probability (1-a). If it loses all its connectivity links always (a=1) then this model is exactly one to one. '),(34,'Spatial one to one with lifetime','The interactions between networks are the same as in the one to one model (bidirectional dependence). Inside the network links are non directed too. In this model not all the nodes of a network are necessarily connected. There is a \'distance\' between nodes given by the \'length\' of the link.

Here we show that the process of building independent networks into an interconnected network of networks under- goes a structurally sharp transition as the interconnections are formed. Depending on the relative importance of inter- and intra- layer connections, we find that the entire interdependent system can be tuned between two regimes: in one regime, the various layers are structurally decoupled and they act as independent entities; in the other regime, network layers are indistinguishable and the whole system behaves as a single- level network.  We analytically show that the transition between the two regimes is discontinuous even for finite-size networks.

Different from previous works which only strive to solve this problem heuristically, this paper formulates it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). In multi-layer networks, diversity of the working and backup paths is important because a single link failure in the lower layer can result in failures of all the upper-layer links that go through it. Thus, we further strengthen the proposed ILP model by incorporating the objective of finding effective backup paths during the application request mapping process. This is achieved by exploiting the substrate topology information.  The effectiveness of the proposed ILP model is verified through extensive simulations. This novel ILP model is proved to perform significantly better in terms of QoS performance as compared to the heuristic solutions. Moreover, the proposed ILP model can provide diversified working and backup paths using few additional substrate nodes.','In this paper they talk about a substrate network (physical network) and overlay network (computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network can be thought of as being connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network). To tackle the problem \"given a substrate network with QoS and candidate information, how should one place an overlay request with QoS constraints so as to maximize the performance of the mapped overlay whilst increasing its resilience with the least substrate resources possible\" is developed in the paper an Integer Lineal Program model that can solve the overlay mapping of nodes and edges while achieving enhanced QoS and resilience performance. The ILP model is also improved to secure diversified working and backup paths allocation. Finally through extensive simulations, the proposed overlay mapping model is proved to perform better than QoSmap (the latest one at that moment).','proceedings'),(38,'Analysis of communication network performance from a complex network perspective','IEEE','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(39,'Analysis of fracture network connectivity using percolation theory','Springer','not-in-selection',1995,'','','journal'),(40,'Analysis of percolation behaviors of clustered networks with partial support--dependence relations','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),(41,'Analysis of percolation behaviors of clustered networks with partial support–dependence relations','ScienceDirect','Analysis-of-percolation',2014,'We carry out a study of percolation behaviors of clustered networks with partial support–dependence relations by adopting two different attacking strategies, attacking only one network and both networks, which help to further understand real coupled networks. For two different attacking strategies we find that the system changes from a second-order phase transition to a first-order phase transition as coupling strength q increases. We also notice that the first-order region becomes smaller and the second-order region becomes larger as average degree or clustering coefficient increases. And, as the average supported degree approaches infinity, coupled clustered networks become independent and only the second-order transition is observed, which is similar to q = 0. Furthermore, we find that clustering coefficient has a significant impact on robustness of the system for strong coupling strength, but for weak coupling strength it has little influence, especially for attacking both networks. The study implies that we can obtain a more robust network by reducing clustering coefficient and increasing average degree for strong coupling strength. However, for weak coupling strength, a more robust network is obtained only by increasing average degree for the same support average degree. Additionally, we find that for attacking both networks the system becomes more vulnerable and difficult to defend compared to attacking only one network.','A percolation threshold study is performed for networks with different characteristics. They vary the coupling coefficient q , the clustering coefficient c, and the place in the network where the attacks are performed (network A, B or both). They consider: 1.- a functional node must have at least one functional support node in other networks 2.- a functional node must belong to the giant component of functional nodes in the network it belongs to. They find that depending on the attack strategy the system shows behaviors of first order and second order phase transition, they observe that the region of first order phase transition becomes smaller, while the region of second order phase transition becomes larger as ⟨k⟩ (average node degree) or c increases. As average supported degree k ̃ → ∞ (this degree is the amount of nodes that support others), coupled clustered networks become independent and behave similarly to a single clustered network. And the system becomes robust as ⟨k⟩ increases for the different clustered coefficients. For strong coupling strength, pAc (critical threshold of net A) or pc (critical/percolation threshold) increases and the system becomes vulnerable as c increases. However, as c changes, pAc or pc don\'t change significantly for weak coupling strength.

In this paper, the robustness of interdependent networks coupled with different type networks is studied in detail under both targeted and random attack. The critical fraction of nodes leading to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks is analyzed. Some findings are summarized as: (i) For random attack problem, the existence criteria for the giant component in interdependent networks coupled by two dif- ferent type networks are quite different from those coupled by the same type networks. Different type coupled networks are more vulnerable than the same type coupled-networks. (ii) For targeted attack problem, if the highly connected nodes are protected and only the lowly connected nodes failed, the system leads to a first order percolation phase transition for different type coupled-networks, and a second transition for same type coupled-networks as well. The available result implies that different type coupled-networks are difficult to defend by strategies such as protecting the high degree nodes that can be useful to significantly improve robustness of the same type coupled-networks. (iii) For targeted attack problem, when the lowly connected nodes are protected and only the highly connected nodes failed, coupled scale free networks become more vulnerable than the others.','This paper confronts the problem of the homogeneity in the networks that are coupled in many studies. Most of the papers assume that the networks coupled are, structuraly speaking, the same. For example it\'s really common to see 2 scale-free networks coupled together or 2 erdos-renyi. However, the authors argue, that this is not the case in real life. So this paper compares the behavior of same type networks coupled vs different type. They also test its behaviour by protecting high or low degree nodes. They use one to one coupling and test percolation thresholds to look up the resilience of the networks under attack. It is found that: Different type coupled-networks are more vulnerable than the same type coupled-networks. Different type coupled-networks are difficult to defend by strategies such as protecting the high degree nodes. If only lowly connected nodes were attacked, the system can still lead to a first order percolation phase transition. If only the highly connected nodes were attacked, coupled scale free networks become more vulnerable than the others.','journal'),(71,'Cascade-based attack vulnerability on the US power grid','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(72,'Cascade-based attacks on complex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2002,'','','journal'),(73,'Cascaded failures in weighted networks','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(74,'Cascades on a class of clustered random networks','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(75,'Cascades on correlated and modular random networks','APS','not-in-selection',2008,'','','journal'),(76,'Cascading dynamics in congested complex networks','Springer','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(77,'Cascading dynamics on random networks: Crossover in phase transition','APS','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),(78,'Cascading dynamics with local weighted flow redistribution in interdependent networks','Springer','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(79,'Cascading failure in Watts--Strogatz small-world networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),(80,'Cascading failure spreading on weighted heterogeneous networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2008,'','','journal'),(81,'Cascading failure tolerance of modular small-world networks','IEEE','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(82,'Cascading failures and the emergence of cooperation in evolutionary-game based models of social and economical networks','AIP','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(83,'Cascading failures in bi-partite graphs: model for systemic risk propagation','nature','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(84,'Cascading failures in complex infrastructure systems','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(85,'Cascading failures in coupled map lattices','APS','not-in-selection',2004,'','','journal'),(86,'Cascading failures in interconnected networks with dynamical redistribution of loads','ScienceDirect','Cascade-of-failures-in-interc',2015,'Cascading failures of loads in isolated networks and coupled networks have been studied in the past few years.

Here, we present an interconnected network model considering cascading failures based on the dynamic redistribution of flow in the networks. Compared with the results of single scale-free networks, we find that interconnected scale-free networks have higher vulnerability. Additionally, the network heterogeneity plays an important role in the robustness of interconnected networks under intentional attacks. Considering the effects of various coupling preferences, the results show that there are almost no differences. Finally, the application of our model to the Beijing interconnected traffic network, which consists of a subway network and a bus network, shows that the subway network suffers more damage under the attack. Moreover, the interconnected traffic network may be more exposed to damage after initial attacks on the bus network. These discussions are important for the design and optimization of interconnected networks.','This paper studies flow dinamics on interconnected networks. They assume that each node in a network can manage a given amount of load and have an \"alpha\": tolerance parameter that helps to determine the load capacity. They test 3 types of coupling Random Coupling, Asortative Coupling, Dissasortative Coupling. Whenever a node is removed the load is redistributed, this may cause that some nodes become congested. When a node gets congested their counterparts in the other networks receive the overflow. This whole approach have a transpotation focus (bus - subway networks) which explains the model. In this paper 2 types of attack are tested: random and targeted to the node with the highest load. On each test it is considered that only 1 node is removed due to the attack and then the consecuent cascading failures end the attack. To measure robustness \"global efficiency is used\". The coupling kind assumed is one to one and the simulated data of networks come from ER-ER and SF-SF networks with the same amount of nodes. The real \"Traffic networks of beijing city\" are used to test the attacks too, in this case the bus and metro network are used but they don\'t have the same amount of nodes so each node of the subway network is conected to the \"corresponding\" bus station but not every bus station is connected to a subway station.

The former one happens due to the interdependence between power grid and communication networks. The latter one is caused by the load propagation in the single power grid. A tiny failure leads to the simultaneous occurrence of these two cascading failures. In this paper, we study the system robustness by considering the interdependence and load propagation. First, we develop a mathematical tool to analyze the load propagation in single network. Then, a percolation- based method is proposed to calculate the remaining fractions of survivals after the cascading failures stop. We estimate the node tolerance parameter T (the ratio of capacity to initial workload) threshold Tc′, below which the entire system may suffer from the cascading failure.The effect of interdependence on Tc′ is also studied, where lower Tc′ is required for the less compact interdependence. We prove that the system performance approaches to the upper bound once the tolerance parameter T → ∞. Our analysis indicates that the fraction of survivals in the power grid is always greater than that in communication network, although the initial failure occurs in the power grid. The extensive simulations validate our mathematical analysis, and demonstrate that the relation between the number of initial failures and tolerance parameter threshold is super-linear.','A novel framework is proposed where the model of the interdependent networks are not only subjected to the cascading failures due to the interconected nature of the network but also due to load failures (takes into account flow stuff). This work consider power and communication networks coupled together by the \"k-n\" model. Nodes in the power network have a tolerance parameter which helps determine how much load they can take. Using techniques similar to percolation threshold, they estimate the final size of the largest connected component after cascading failures.

We numerically find that the AL (high-degree nodes in network A connect high-degree ones in network B) link between two networks can greatly enhance the robust level of the interdependent networks against cascading failures. Especially we observe that the values of βc in the interdependent networks with both the DL (high-degree nodes in network A connect low-degree ones in network B) link and the RL (nodes in network A randomly connect ones in network B) link increase monotonically with the coupled strength, while the values of βc,s in the interdependent networks with three types of link patterns almost monotonically decreases with the coupled strength. In the interdependent networks with the AL,the value of βc first decreases and then increases with the coupled strength. We further explain this interesting phenomenon by a simple graph. In addition, we study the influence of the coupled strength on the efficiency of two attacks to destroy the interdependent networks. We find that, when the coupled strength between two networks is weaker, attacking the edges with the lower load is more easier to trigger the cascading propagation than attacking the nodes with the higher load, however, when the coupled strength in two networks is stronger, the case is on the contrary. Finally, we give reasonable explanations from the local perspective of the total capacity of all neighboring edges of a failed edge.','In this paper networks are considered to have load capacities, coupling strength and cascading failures due to overload. This paper focuses on attacks towards edges and the subsequent effect of this on the load of the networks. In this case if a node becomes overloaded it fails and therefore their coupled counterpart fails too, spreading the problem. If an edge fails the overload is redistributed on the same network. The aproach is a one-to-one bidirectional coupling and the nodes are coupled: High-high degrees (AL), high-low degreed (DL), random (RL). The robustness is measured in three ways: The average amount of edges lost after a cascading failure (avalanche), the beta at which the graph presents a phase transition, and the smallest capacity threshold. (beta is the coefficient that determines the capacity). They also define the coupled strength wij between interconnected nodes in different networks  w_{im}=(k_{i}k_{m})^α. WWith the coupling strength the initial load is calculated (with this + beta we get the capacity).

The interesting result is that the coupled strength plays the different roles in three types of link patterns. When the coupled strength is weaker, the edges with the lower load play an important role in the cascading propagation, which gives us an implication that protecting these intuitive unimportant edges may dramatically enhance the robustness of the interdependent networks.\"','journal'),(94,'Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks','nature','nature08932',2010,'Complex networks have been studied intensively for a decade, but research still focuses on the limited case of a single, non-interacting network1–14.

A fun- damental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures (‘concurrent malfunction’) is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations20. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact ana- lytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distri- bution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.','The paper presents the situation of the 2003 blackout on Italy as a start point to develop a framework that allows the study of interdependent networks with cascading failures.

Then the theory of the model is explained as well as its behaviour in terms of percolation. The model is solved for some network distributions by using the generating function approach.

[1], we use a more realistic model of the electricity network by taking the essential characteristics of the power flow into account, instead of considering purely the topological structure. The effect of the flow-based cascading failures originating from the electrical grid, on the communication network is studied, where the coupling between those networks plays an important role. We have computed the performanceof our proposed selection strategies by averaging over many configurations of communication networks, which are modelled both as scale-free networks and as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, applied to an electricity network formed by the IEEE 118  bus test system. We show that a hybrid strategy, based on the degree of the communication nodes and the failure probabilities of the electricity nodes, give a significant improvement over a random selection strategy, as well as over other strategies we proposed. Our method is also tested on a real-world interdependent network: the high voltage electricity grid in Italy coupled with a communication network, inspired by the Italy blackout in 2003.','This paper treat the topic of communication-power grid networks taking into account flow dynamics on the electric network and a one directional coupling model. Here is stated that the power grid does not depend on the standar communication network but rather on its own SCADA network and that communication network does depend on the electricity network. In order to design a more robust network, since is too expensive to redesign a network they propose to have some communication nodes decoupled by making them self suficient. They too say that this can be done just for some nodes due to the costs involved. On this model they use equations to simulate the flow of energy through the electricity network, whenever a node exceeds or lower its flow enough it becomes non-functional. In this paper several \'robusting\' strategies are proved (1.-The reference scenario, where no nodes are autonomous.2.-Nodes from the communication network or electricity network are chosen uniformly random.3.-Nodes with the highest degree in the electricity network are chosen.5.-Nodes with the lowest degree in the electricity network are chosen.6.-Nodes with the highest probability to fail in the electricity network are chosen.7.-Linear hybrid of strategy 3 and 6.7.-Non-linear hybrid of strategy 3 and 6), being the hybrid strategies (degree + probability of collapse) the most effective at improving the robustness of the coupled system against random attacks.','proceedings'),(132,'Designing and embedding reliable virtual infrastructures','ACM','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(133,'Designing resilient networks using a hybrid genetic algorithm approach','ACM','not-in-selection',2005,'','','proceedings'),(134,'Designing survivable resilient networks: a stochastic hybrid genetic algorithm approach','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),(135,'Detecting Critical Nodes in Interdependent Power Networks for Vulnerability Assessment','IEEE','6407159',2013,'Power networks and information systems become more and more interdependent to ensure better supports for the functionality as well as improve the economy. However, power networks also tend to be more vulnerable due to the cascading failures from their interdependent information systems, i.e., the failures in the information systems can cause the failures of the coupled portion in power networks. Therefore, the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND) optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an in- terdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of ￼ (2 - epsilon). Despite its intractability, we propose a greedy framework with novel centrality functions based on the networks’ interdependencies, to efficiently solve this problem in a timely manner.

Then it shows that the IPND (Interdependent Power Network Disruptor:  identify critical nodes in an interdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network) problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated, so they proceed to propose a greedy framework and centrality measues extended to fit the interconected nature of the networks.

Tree strategies are used to choose the most critical node: node that maximizes the number of failed nodes after the cascading failure,node that decreases the structural strength of the system as much as possible, node that not only increases the number of failed nodes but decreases the structural strength as well.

The underlying assumption is that all networks share the same size. However, this setting cannot capture real-world coupled networks very well. Hence, in this paper, we explore how different network sizes affect cascades from the perspective of the whole interconnected networks. We find that when two networks with similar sizes are coupled, the interconnected networks are the most fragile for sparse coupling while they are the most robust for dense coupling. Moreover, we also study the effect of network size on the robustness of individual network. We find that when two networks with different sizes are coupled, the larger one is more robust for sparse coupling, while more fragile for dense coupling.','Here a framework that considers flows and capacities on its model is presented. Unlike other similar models this consider that the 2 networks paticipating can have different sizes (although they have the same average degree). Characteristics of the model presented in this framework are: there can be a transference of traffic between networks through the interlinks, the coupling is assortative by load order or random depending on the case tested. In this framework the load that each node can take is given by their inicial betweennes centrality pondered by a factor of (1+alfa). The relative size of the largest component after failure G, the relative size of the largest component of one network after failure compared to the total giant component at the moment f(A) and alfa_0,5, the alfa where g=0,5 is used to study the resilience of the network. The size of the original giant component is the sum of the sizes of the two original networks. Once the interconnected system has been attacked and the cascading failure is over, a node must belong to the giant connected component to be functional. Tests were performed for varying amount of interlinks (L), N_b (size of net B), and kind of coupling. For each test 30 to 40 cases were used.

We find here that a similar result is valid for any finite value of q with a larger rc as q decreases. We also provide a theoretical approach which correctly predicts the relationship between rc and q. We also examine the dynamics at the percolation threshold pc for varying r and q and find that there are three different mechanisms of failure for every q depending on r. Below rc the system undergoes a continuous transition similar to standard percolation. Above rc there are two distinct first-order transitions for finite or infinite r, respectively.The transition for finite r is characterized by spreading of node failures through the system while the infinite r corresponds to a non-spatial cascading failure similar to the case of random networks. These results extend previous results on spatially embedded interdependent networks to the more realistic cases of partial dependency and shed new light on the specific dynamics of cascading failures in such systems.','This paper studies the relation between the degree of dependece on intercontected network and the maximum length of the interdependent links for the network to have a second order transition (after this maximum length the network will have a first order percolation transtion/ an abrupt transition).

They look at the behaviour of the giant component (largest connected component) near the percolation threshold for different r values (0<r<r_c, r>= r_c, r = inf) and find relationships between them. They find that interdependent networks can avoid spreading catastrophic cascades only if the distance between interdependent nodes is below rc, though increasing the distance to a value much greater than rc can also provide a small increase in robustness with respect to random attacks.','proceedings'),(228,'Introduction to percolation theory','CRC','not-in-selection',1994,'','','book'),(229,'Is multilayer networking feasible?','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(230,'Jamming transition in air transportation networks','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(231,'Knowledge diffusion in the collaboration hypernetwork','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),(232,'Laplacian Eigenvectors of Graphs.

Here, we study a general model of spatially embedded networks with dependencies under localized attacks. We develop a theoretical and numerical approach to describe and predict the effects of localized attacks on spatially embedded systems with dependencies. Surprisingly, we find that a localized attack can cause substantially more damage than an equivalent random attack. Furthermore, we find that for a broad range of parameters, systems which appear stable are in fact metastable.Though robust to random failures—even of finite fraction—if subjected to a localized attack larger than a critical size which is independent of the system size (i.e., a zero fraction), a cascading failure emerges which leads to complete system collapse.','This paper proposes an approach to describe and predict the effects of localized attacks on spatially embedded systems with dependencies. To do so 2D \'diluted\' lattices with edge length constraints are considered to represent interdimentional networks. It is found that there are 3 possible states : stable, metastable, unestable when under \"local attacks\". A local attack is one that is centered on a node and affects nodes (destroys them) on a specific radius. Interdependent lattices are stable if under any radius of attack  (infinite) they don\'t collapse, metastable if under a certain attack radius is stable but above that radius it collapses and unestable if even a zero radius attacks makes the networks collapse. This work presents a complete analytical and simulation results to identify the interdependent lattice state. The results are in great concordance with the expected results from the analitycal part. IIt showed that local attacks bounded to \'physical\' radius can be catastrophic in a wide range of cases (interconected networks) while on a single lattice the local attack might not have an effect at all.

The degree-based weighting scheme was extended to interdependent networks, with the flow dynamics dominated by global redistribution based on weighted betweenness centrality. Through contingency analysis of one-node removal, we demonstrated that there still exists an optimal weighting parameter on interdependent networks, but it might shift as compared to the case in isolated networks because of the break of symmetry. And it will be easier for the symmetrically and asymmetrically coupled interdependent networks to achieve robustness and better cost configuration against the one-node-removal-induced cascade of load failures when coupling strength was weaker. Our findings might have great generality for characterizing load-failure-induced cascading dynamics in real-world degree-based weighted interdependent networks.','This paper studies de Global load-based redistribution by assigning the load through intra-degree and inter-degree properties. The robustness is measured by removing each node once and re-adjusting the capacities of the nodes to take the load of the one node removal without falling apart.

Whereas theoretical methods of direct applicability to real isolated networks exist, the frameworks developed so far in percolation theory for interdependent network layers are of little help in practical contexts, as they are suited only for special models in the limit of infinite size. Here, we introduce a set of heuristic equations that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these systems into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a smooth percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in small networks. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing cores of ‘high quality’ edges to prevent catastrophic failures.','This paper proposes a method to satudy the percolation thresholds of complex coupled networks. It recognizes problems on the assumptions of previous model (the graph models topology is not specified by a one-zero adjacency matrix, they\'re applied to infinitely large systems) that real interconnected networks don\'t possess. Then a methodology to describe percolation transitions is explained. By defining several concepts and steps the paper arrives to an euristic equation for the probability that a node i is in the largest mutually connected cluster of the system. They determine that the percolation transition depends on size of the intersection of the graph vs the remainder. The method is tested by comparing empyrical results against the theoretical results obtained from the heuristic equation. One thing apreciated is that in heterogeneous graphs the nature of transition is not determined by the number of edges shared across the layers but their quality. The results of the theoretical and empyrical results are very similar concluding that the framework is able to help identify cores of quality links that can prevent catastrophic failures in real systems.','journal'),(323,'Percolation in self-similar networks','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(324,'Percolation of a general network of networks','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(325,'Percolation of interdependent networks with intersimilarity','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(326,'Percolation of localized attack on complex networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2015,'','','journal'),(327,'Percolation of partially interdependent networks under targeted attack','APS','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),(328,'Percolation of partially interdependent scale-free networks','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(329,'Percolation on dense graph sequences','IMS','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),(330,'Percolation on interacting networks','arXiv','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(331,'Percolation on interacting, antagonistic networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(332,'Percolation on sparse networks','APS','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),(333,'Percolation theory applied to measures of fragmentation in social networks','APS','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),(334,'Percolation theory on interdependent networks based on epidemic spreading','IOP','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),(335,'Percolation transitions are not always sharpened by making networks interdependent','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(336,'Performance analysis of complex networks and systems','CUP','not-in-selection',2014,'','','book'),(337,'Performance and reliability of electrical power grids under cascading failures','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(338,'Perspectives on risk management in supply chains','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(339,'PlanetLab project','ONLINE','not-in-selection',2030,'','','ONLINE'),(340,'Power-law distributions in empirical data','SIAM','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(341,'Preferential attachment in the interaction between dynamically generated interdependent networks','IOP','not-in-selection',2012,'','','journal'),(342,'Proactive robustness control of heterogeneously loaded networks','APS','not-in-selection',2006,'','','journal'),(343,'Probabilistic study of cascading failures in complex interdependent lifeline systems','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(344,'Promoting collective motion of self-propelled agents by distance-based influence','APS','not-in-selection',2014,'','','journal'),(345,'Protecting infrastructure networks from cost-based attacks','IOP','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(346,'QoSMap: achieving quality and resilience through overlay construction','IEEE','not-in-selection',2009,'','','proceedings'),(347,'QoSMap: QoS aware mapping of virtual networks for resiliency and efficiency','IEEE','not-in-selection',2007,'','','proceedings'),(348,'Random Graphs','Springer','not-in-selection',1985,'','','journal'),(349,'Random graphs containing arbitrary distributions of subgraphs','APS','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),(350,'Random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions and their applications','APS','not-in-selection',2001,'','','journal'),(351,'Random graphs with clustering','APS','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(352,'Random walks on complex networks','APS','not-in-selection',2004,'','','journal'),(353,'Reaction--diffusion processes and metapopulation models in heterogeneous networks','nature','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),(354,'Recent development on supply chain supernetwork modeling','Shanghai.LD','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(355,'Recovering from disruptions of interdependent critical infrastructures','-','not-in-selection',2001,'','','proceedings'),(356,'Recovery from malicious transactions','IEEE','not-in-selection',2002,'','','journal'),(357,'Reflection on supernetwork','Shanghai.LD','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(358,'Reliability Analysis of Interdependent Networks Using Percolation Theory','IEEE','6727252',2013,'Many complex systems have functional interde- pendency between each other and can be modeled as interdepen- dent networks.

In this paper, we propose a novel interdependent network model which consists of two individual networks with unequal numbers of nodes and one-to-multiple weighted dependency links between the two networks. Based on realistic assumptions, this model differs from previous works that considered equal numbers of nodes in the two networks and identical dependency links. We formulate an optimization problem to allocate dependency links using least resources. This novel model enhances the practicability of traditional cyber–physical system structures, but it makes the dependency link deployment problem more complex and the optimization problem cannot be solved in large networks. To overcome this problem, we propose a new algorithm based on a revised network flow method. Extensive simulations on random networks and real networks show that our deployment method produces topologies that are more robust than the ones obtained by other deployment techniques. Results indicate that our algorithm is efficient and cost-effective in designing robust interdependent networks, and our deployment method is suitable for networks of any size.','This paper tackles the problem of allocating links (dependency links that connect 2 different networks in particular) given that each one have a cost and there\'s a budget (a limit to the amount of link you can afford). Here, as in other papers, the biggest connected component is the one that\'s considered functional. However they propose a one-to-multiple dependence over networks that are no neccesarily the same one or have the same amount of nodes (Although for simulation pourposes they couple networks with the same \"structure\"). For a node to properly function it has to be connected to the largest connected component and have at least one dependency link. The robustness metric they use is the average value of the size of the largest connected component divided by the original size of the network for each network. The allocation process is divided on 2 steps. The first one is Basic connectivity to ensure that every node has at least one dependency link (you need max(Na,Nb) links). The second step is the augmented connectivity, here the remaining budget is use according to some strategy. The authors say that \"the aim of augmented connectivity is to achieve minimum variance of node degree\" (for better robustness).

A real-world example is the Italian blackout of 2003, when a small failure in the power grid cascaded between the two networks and led to a massive blackout. In this paper, we study the minimum number of node failures needed to cause total blackout (i.e., all nodes in both networks to fail).In the case of unidirectional interdependency between the networks we show that the problem is NP-hard, and develop heuristics to find a near-optimal solution. On the other hand, we show that in the case of bidirectional interdependency this problem can be solved in polynomial time. We believe that this new interdependency model gives rise to important, yet unexplored, robust network design problems for interdependent networked infrastructures.','In this paper the authors analyze the robustness of interdependent networks where the interdependencies are manifested 2 ways. For each way they want to know the minimum number of node failures needed to cause total blackout. They focus on the example of SCADA-Power grid dependencies. The first case considered is the unidirectional dependency case where if a router node depends on a certain power node it doesn\'t mean that power node depends on that router node. The second case is the one to one dependency where if one of the coupled nodes fails the other fails as well. The former case is proven to be an NP-complete problem so heuristics to tackle it are given, while the latter case is a polynomial problem. The tests are performed over star like networks to measure the effects of the interdependencies on the cascading failures and those effects only (star like means that, for ex., on the power grid every node is connected to the generator and generators can function by themselves). With this last assumption the coupled networks can be seen as bipartite graphs. They found that the network of Italy is robust to total failure. However, they showed that parts of the network are very vulnerable to failures. The robustness metric used is the minimun number of nodes that must be removed for total collapse.','proceedings'),(382,'Robustness of multilayer oscillator networks','APS','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(383,'Robustness of n interdependent networks with partial support-dependence relationship','IOP','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(384,'Robustness of network of networks under targeted attack','APS','not-in-selection',2013,'','','journal'),(385,'Robustness of the European power grids under intentional attack','APS','not-in-selection',2008,'','','journal'),(386,'Robustness of the western United States power grid under edge attack strategies due to cascading failures','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(387,'Role of optical network and spare router strategy in resilient IP backbone architecture','IEEE','not-in-selection',2003,'','','proceedings'),(388,'Roles of mixing patterns in cooperation on a scale-free networked game','APS','not-in-selection',2007,'','','journal'),(389,'Router security configuration guide, version 1.1 b','TechRep SNAC NSA','not-in-selection',2003,'','','techreport'),(390,'Routing in scale-free networks based on expanding betweenness centrality','ScienceDirect','not-in-selection',2011,'','','journal'),(391,'Rules for biologically inspired adaptive network design','AAAS','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),(392,'Sandpile cascades on interacting tree-like networks','arXiv','not-in-selection',2010,'','','journal'),(393,'Scale-free networks: a decade and beyond','AAAS','not-in-selection',2009,'','','journal'),(394,'Scale-free user-network approach to telephone network traffic analysis','APS','not-in-selection',2005,'','','journal'),(395,'Scaling approach to anisotropic magnetic systems statics','Springer','not-in-selection',1969,'','','journal'),(396,'Scaling approach to tricritical phase transitions','APS','not-in-selection',1972,'','','journal'),(397,'Scientific collaboration networks.

Besides widely used metric giant component, we study small cluster (small component) in interdependent networks after cascading failures occur. We first introduce an overview on how small clusters distribute in various single networks. Then we propose a percolation theory based mathematical method to study how small clusters be affected by the interdependence between two coupled networks. We prove that the upper bounds exist for both the fraction and the number of operating small clusters. Without loss of generality, we apply both synthetic network and real network data in simulation to study small clusters under different interdependence models and network topologies. The extensive simulations highlight our findings: except the giant component, considerable proportion of small clusters exists, with the remaining part fragmenting to very tiny pieces or even massive isolated single vertex; no matter how the two networks are tightly coupled, an upper bound exists for the size of small clusters. We also discover that the interdependent small-world networks generally have the highest fractions of operating small clusters. Three attack strategies are compared: Inter Degree Priority Attack, Intra Degree Priority Attack and Random Attack. We observe that the fraction of functioning small clusters keeps stable and is independent from the attack strategies.','Here a different view on the robustness measurements is shown. The authors say that measuring the largest connected component and assuming that a node that\'s not connected to it is non operational is wrong. Instead they propose to take into account the amount of small clusters that remain functional after an attack. A node remains operational if it is connected to a cluster with a minimum size delta and it is interconnected. They also propose an alternative to the one to one coupling that they call \"k-n\", in this coupling they have unidirectional links and two types of nodes (one connects with k other nodes, the other with n). They show that the semaller the delta the more robust is the network.

In a limited range of weighting parameters, degree-based weighting scheme outweigh clustering-based scheme. Outside of that range, clustering-based weighting scheme outweigh degree-based scheme.

Each subnetwork grows through the addition of new nodes with constant accelerating random attachment in the first model but with preferential attachment in the second model. The two subnetworks interact with multi-support and undirectional dependence links. The effects of dependence relations and strength between subnetworks are analyzed in the percolation behavior of fully interdependent networks against random failure, both theoretically and numerically, and as a result, for both relations: interdependent SF networks show a second-order percolation phase transition and the increased dependence strength decreases the robustness of the system, whereas, interdependent ER networks show the opposite results. In addition, the power-law relation between networks yields greater robustness than the exponential one at the given dependence strength.','In this paper they present a simple framework but with 2 different models possible. To resume: once the network is modeled they test the resilience by measuring the percolation threshold for each initial p. The models are constructed on steps where nodes and links are added. There are two types of links: connectivity links (intra) and dependency links (inter). The first model begins with m0 nodes and n0 connectivity links on each network (A and B), on each step t it add a node to every network. Each node in A adds mA links, it attaches itself with a 1-qa fraction of nodes in the same network through connectivity links. The rest of the links are dependency links who are attached to nodes in B. (For each node in B is the same). The second model is initiated in the same way but when the nodes are added on each network and on each step t the link addition it\'s done by the constant acceleration scenario. Given the new node in A, this scenario adds a connectivity link between 2 nodes in A with probability s, it must be satisfied that the expected amount of links is st. In the case of the addition of dependency links they can be added at random or preferentially (DL) (exponenctial dependence-degree dist or power-law-degree dist.).  This second model ends up creating a ER network with poisson degree distribution. The tests performed study the percolation threshold pc for different q (level of dependence), and the sizes of the largest connected components depending on p (the cascading process begins by removing 1-p nodes from network A). A node is considered functional if it belongs to the largest connected component and has at leats 1 dependency link.

Above a critical fraction of interdependent nodes, even a single node failure can invoke cascading failures that may abruptly fragment the system, whereas below this critical dependency a failure of a few nodes leads only to a small amount of damage to the system. So far, research has focused on interdependent random networks without space limitations. However, many real systems, such as power grids and the Internet, are not random but are spatially embedded. Here we analytically and numerically study the stability of interdependent spatially embedded networks modelled as lattice networks. Surprisingly, we find that in lattice systems, in contrast to non-embedded systems, there is no critical dependency and any small fraction of interdependent nodes leads to an abrupt collapse. We show that this extreme vulnerability of very weakly coupled lattices is a consequence of the critical exponent describing the percolation transition of a single lattice.','The paper begins explaining that not all networks are random and that in many cases these are spatially embedded. In order to study the effects of this kind of structure they use percolation theory and lattice graphs, though they acknowlodge that most of these networks are not lattices. In this paper they show the theory using interdependent networks composed by two networks. It is focused on the case where both networks have the same degree distribution. With this they proceed to analyze the size of the giant component at criticality in function of the coupling strenght q, for this, they used different simulated and real networks coupled together. It concludes that for spatially embedded networks even a weak coupling lead to a relatively large-scale collapse while for random networks the discontinuity size does not have a singular point.

We apply this study to the case of existing interdependent networks, namely a Spanish scientific community of Statistical Physics, formed by a social network of scientific collaborations and a physical network of connected computers in each institution.

This is a multi-layered network where on each network there\'s the same amount of nodes and each node has the same id on each network, here there are no links between layers, instead the nodes with the same id share the same \'\'state\'\'. In this paper the states are given by a SIS epidemic model (Infected, susceptible). On this model each layer exhibits a different contagion pattern. The contagion patern is measured over time considering the probability of get infected or the probability of recovery. The robustness of the network is measured through the density of infected nodes. They test their proposal using the Spanish Statistical Physics networks, 2 layers are defined: physical and social. On each layer the authors are nodes. On the physical layer the links represent that they belong to the same university and department or that they belong to the same research center. On the social network the links represent collaboration between authors. The experiments were averaged over 200 realizations and they all start with the network fully infected. The results show that the dynamics of the SIS contagion proces in SINs where the states of the nodes must be layer-independent is equivalent to the spreading in a mono-layer governed by the effective contagion.','journal'),(490,'W32. stuxnet dossier','whitepaper symantec','not-in-selection',2011,'','','whitepaper'),(491,'What energy functions can be minimized via graph cuts?','IEEE','not-in-selection',2004,'','','journal'),(492,'Complex interdependent supply chain networks: Cascading failure and robustness','ScienceDirect','Complex-interdependent',2016,'A supply chain network is a typical interdependent network composed of an undirected cyber-layer network and a directed physical-layer network.

We consider load propagation via connectivity links as node failure spreads through one layer of an interdependent network, and we develop a priority redistribution strategy for failed loads subject to flow constraint. Using a giant component function and a one-to-one directed interdependence relation between nodes in a cyber-layer network and physical-layer network, we construct time-varied functional equations to quantify the dynamic process of failed loads propagation in an interdependent network. Finally, we conduct a numerical simulation for two cases, i.e., single node removal and multiple node removal at the initial disruption. The simulation results show that when we increase the number of removed nodes in an interdependent supply chain network its robustness undergoes a first-order discontinuous phase transition, and that even removing a small number of nodes will cause it to crash.','This paper propos a model for interdependent supply chain network composed by a physical network and a logical network. Each network is slightly different, but both have load capacities on its nodes and edges and the same amount of nodes. The physical network is a directed network representing the physical supply chain (suppliers, manufacterers, etc.) and logical network is a non directed graph. In this framework the model presented follows a one to one relation in the sense that a node in one network is conected to only one node on the other network, these dependencies may be uni or bidirectional. Nodes may fail due to attacks or overloads. A node is considered functional if it belongs to the largest connected component and survives the cascading failures, the rest of the nodes that survive but don\'t belong to the largest connected component are considered partially functional. They tested the robustness of the interdependent supply chain network by removing 1 node on the logical network or a fraction 1-p of it, 1 node on the physical network or a fraction 1-p of it and a fraction 1-p between the 2 networks. The tests performed tunned the parameter of the networks (load capacities) to study the supply chain.

Additionally, for both conditions, the results suggest that increasing density of connectivity links (intra-connectivity links or inter-connectivity links) can increase the robustness of the system, while the interdependency links decrease its robustness. Furthermore, by comparing critical attacking strength under same parameters for both conditions, we also find that feedback condition of dependency links, in contrast to no-feedback condition, makes the system extremely vulnerable.

For this purpose, the traffic flow transport model [1] will be adopted. If one node fails, it may likely change the traffic flow paths between itself and other remote nodes thereby causing global failures.

Label the two networks as A and B. Without loss of generality, the number of nodes in the coupled networks A and B is assumed to be the same, NA = NB = N, with the same degree distribution.\"\r\n\r\n\"[MODEL] The two BA networks are interconnected by some links. These links provide paths for the traffic flow between the two coupled networks. Data packets can be delivered along the links between the two networks. A coupling probability p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) is used. It can be described as ‘the number of interconnected links divided by the network size N’. Assume that each node has at most one interconnected link to the other network.\"\r\n\r\n\"[MODEL] In the interconnected network, if some nodes of one network fail, then the nodes of the other network may also fail, due to cascading reactions and failure propagation from one network to another, thus leading to catastrophic failures eventually. To study these cascading failures caused by traffic overload dynamics, we assume that the load on one node can be redistributed to anywhere in the whole interconnected network through connecting links.\"\r\n\r\n\"[DEFINITION] To describe the new model, we introduce three coupling preferences based on load distribution in a BA scale-free network [23].\r\n• Assortative coupling pattern: The nodes of network A are sorted in the descending order according to their loads, labeled as x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , where if some nodes have the same load, then randomly arrange them; nodes in network B are sorted in the same way, labeled as y1 , y2 , . . . , yn . Connect x1 with y1 , connect x2 with y2 , and so on. Finally, randomly connect N × p links between networks A and B.\r\n• Disassortative coupling pattern. The nodes of network A are sorted in the descending order according to their loads, labeled as x1, x2, . . . , xn. On the contrary, nodes in network B are sorted in the ascending order, labeled as y1, y2, . . . , yn. Connect x1 with y1, connect x2 with y2, and so on. Finally, randomly connect N × p links between the networks A and B.\r\n• Random coupling pattern. In each of the two networks, randomly select one node respectively. If neither of them has an interconnected link, then connect them. Thus, a total of N × p links will be connected randomly between the networks A and B.\"\r\n\r\n\"betweenness of node i is used to evaluate its load in the whole networks, (...)\"\r\n\r\n\"The capacity of node i is denoted by Ci.

Here, constant β ≥ 0 is the tolerance (or redundancy) parameter and Li is the initial load of node i.\"\r\n\r\n\"(...) here the traffic load is distributed based on the shortest-path routing rule, i.e. the betweenness of the nodes. Therefore, the removal of any one node may affect all nodes in the network.\"\r\n\r\n\"[MODEL] The dynamical process of the cascading failure can be described as follows: when one node is removed, this can change the shortest paths between other nodes. The data-packets through these nodes have to change their paths to arrive to the destination nodes, consequently the loads of other nodes will be changed (increased). Those nodes that loads exceed these capacities will fail, it can trigger load redistribution over and over again through the whole network, until the network reaches a final stable state.\"\r\n\r\n\"The relative size of the remaining giant component G in network is usually used to measure the functional integrity and robustness of a network.

In previous works, the basic assumption is that networks share the same capacity redundancy. However, this setting cannot capture the real case very well. Hence, in this paper, we analyze the effect of capacity redundancy disparity on the robustness of interconnected networks. In isolated networks, it is well known that the complex network’s robustness can be improved by increasing its capacity redundancy. In interconnected networks where two networks share the same capacity redundancy, the similar result holds. Yet this result is not necessarily true in interconnected networks where two networks are different in capacity redundancy. We find that when the capacity redundancy of one network is fixed, the robustness of the whole system may not follow another network’s capacity redundancy. More specifically, when the fixed network’s capacity redundancy is very small or very large, the robustness of the whole system increases as another network’s capacity redundancy increases. But there exists a certain range within which the increase of one network’s capacity redundancy results in the robustness decline of the whole system.

The percolation threshold is typically denoted by p_c and where p_c represent the critical value of p. In this context 1-p represents the probability of a node of failing or get disconnected. Thus, p_c is the point where no giant component remains (mayor failure of the network). The smaller the value of p_c the more robust is the network (this implies a bigger 1-p_c value and therefore that is necessary to disconnect more nodes to destry the network). When studying percolation phase transitions can be identified, these may be first or second order phase transitions. Second-order phase transitions are charecteristic of single networks, they decay continously when nodes are remodev. First-order phase transitions represent networks where an abrupt decay occurs at some point p_c.

The elements may be removed all at once or one by one.'),(18,'recovery','A recovery process or strategy is studied. Recovery is when, from a fragmented/failure state a network starts to recover nodes to be able to work again.
